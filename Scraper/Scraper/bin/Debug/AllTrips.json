We started with the historical city center and saw the Catedral and the Basilica y convento de San Francisco de Asís.\nWe then headed to Huaca Pucllana where are located amazing ruins from the pre-Inca period (Lima civilization).\n                             \n                               In the afternoon we went to see the Pacific Coast and walked on the beach until sunset. For dinner we had some awesome Ceviche in a place called Cordano (calle Jirón Ancash in the center).\nFor the night we stayed in Lynik Casa de Blanca, a little hostel located a bit away from the center but with very welcoming hosts and nice facilities."},{"Item1":"Day 2: Pucusana & Ica, Peru","Item2":"Pucusana is a little fishermen's town, about 1 hour and half from Lima by bus. The town itself was not very impressive but we took a boat ride around the island where we saw sea lions. The cliff of the island was also quite impressive.\nNonetheless, most people actually recommend to see Paracas, which is supposed to be like Pucusana but even more beautiful and with a richer sea fauna, so if we had to do it again I think we would have headed there instead.\n                             \n                               After lunch we took another bus to Ica (about 4 hours) and spent the evening there (dinner at Restaurant Plaza 125 and night at the Hotel Sol de Ica)."},{"Item1":"Day 3: Ica & Huacachina, Peru","Item2":"Ica is mostly famous because it's near Huacachina (30 minutes taxi ride), a beautiful oasis in the middle of a sand desert. We did sand surfing and buggy there which was quite fun. The buggy was quite impressive although sometimes really scary!\nIn the evening we took an 18-hour bus to Cusco (!). We used the company Cruz del Sur which was really confortable (Cama bus).\n                             \n                               Note: most people go to Arequipa before Cusco because it's easier but we didn't because on Google maps Ica-Cusco-Arequipa looked more natural. So don't make the mistake, save time and go first to Arequipa and then Cusco."},{"Item1":"Days 4-5: Cusco, Peru","Item2":"After a long bus ride we arrived at around 7 AM in Cusco. We looked for a hostel there but the 2 first ones we checked from the guide were all booked. At our 3rd attempt we finally managed to get a room at Cusi Wasi. While it's not needed in most towns I would really recommend to book your accommodation in advance in Cusco.\nWe followed our travel guide there and visited the main spots (Plaza del Armas, Catedral Basílica de la Virgen de la Asunción and la Calle Hatun Rumiyoc).\n                             \n                               In the evening we ate in a very nice restaurant named Granja Heidi. The next day we visited la Iglesia de la compañía de Jesús and la Iglesia y monasterio de la Merced.\nWe then headed in the afternoon to the Inca ruins of Písac by taxi. Finally after this busy day we ate an Alpaca burger in Fuego (okayish)."},{"Item1":"Day 7: Machu Picchu, Peru","Item2":"Here it is: Machu Picchu! We got up at 4 AM and started to walk towards Machu Picchu to reach the Ruinas bridge and checkpoint that opens at 5 AM. After that we had to climb 1716 steps (400m high) to be at the entrance of Machu Picchu before the opening at 6 AM.\nWe walked around on the site and at 7 AM we started climbing Huayna Picchu (the mountain you see on all the Machu Picchu pictures). We rushed because of the rain and were at the summit at 7.30 AM. The mountain was in the clouds and it was impossible to see Machu Picchu then so we waited 3 good hours to finally be able to see something. We then descended and visited Machu Picchu in details.\n                             \n                               We didn't take a guide but retrospectively I think it's a good idea and it's not even that expensive. We also walked until the Inca Bridge where you can see quite an amazing panorama of the valley surrounding Machu Picchu.\nAt about 3.30PM, extremely tired and hungry (we didn't have lunch) but with eyes full of stars, not fully realizing yet the beauty and grandeur of what we had just saw, we took a bus back to Aguas Calientes. We didn't walk back only because our train back to Cusco was at 5 PM. We spent the night at Cusco in the same hostel (Cusi Wasi)."},{"Item1":"Day 8: Arequipa, Peru","Item2":"To save time we travelled by plane to Arequipa instead of by bus. We arrived in the late morning and checked-in at Hostal Solar de Arequipa. We visited la Plaza del Armas and el Monasterio de Santa Catalina. Unfortunately, our time was limited because we had to find a tour starting the next day to visit the Colca Canyon (Cañon del Río de Colca).\nIt was Sunday and most agencies were closed which made it somewhat difficult but finally, after checking different agencies, we found a good one called EcoTours. \n                             \n                               Don't listen to the agencies that tell you it's not allowed to descend in the Canyon, it's just not true and they often say it because they are not specialized in trekking tours but want to get your business anyway.\nIn the evening we ate in a very nice restaurant with a wide variety of potato dishes: Hatunpa."},{"Item1":"Days 9-10: Colca Canyon, Peru","Item2":"For me this is definitely the highlight of the trip after Machu Picchu. The tour bus picked us up very early (4 AM) to reach Chivay where we had breakfast. After that we stopped at the mirador 'La Cruz del Condor' to admire condors flying and have a first look at the Colca canyon (second deepest in the world, deeper than the Grand Canyon in the United States).\nWe then descended the Colca Canyon which represents about 18 km of hiking. We arrived in the afternoon at around 4 PM. There we enjoyed a nice swim in an oasis (Sangalle) with water from the torrents around before having a few drinks, dinner and going to bed early to be in shape for the way back the next day.\n                             \n                               On the second day of the tour we got up early (6 AM) to climbed back the Colca Canyon. It was only 6 km but the way up was 1 km, so it took us about 2 hour and a half to make it.\nAfter that we had breakfast in Cabanaconde and took the bus to visit the surrounding area where we bathed in thermal waters, saw Inca tombs and terrasses and went through a natural park with plenty of Alpacas."},{"Item1":"Day 11: Copacabana (Lake Titicaca), Bolivia","Item2":"We were planning to take a night bus to Puno the night after going back from Colca Canyon or the next day in the morning but, unfortunately, due to strikes all the buses were cancelled so instead we took a plane to La Paz. As soon as we landed we took a but straight to Copacabana where we spent the afternoon and the night.\n                             \n                               We stayed at Hostal La Cúpula which was very good with a nice restaurant. The sunset on Copacabana was especially beautiful."},{"Item1":"Day 12: Isla Del Sol (Titicaca Lake), Bolivia","Item2":"In the morning we took a boat at 8.30 to Isla del Sol. We debarked on the north of the island and started to walk towards the south.\nThe trail was just beautiful: you are on top of the island and can view the Lake Titicaca on both sides of the Isla del Sol. We reached the south of the island in the middle of the afternoon and had lunch.\nWe found a little hostel overlooking the port. There was no heat but this was forgiven with the splendid view and the very kind hosts. In the evening we had dinner at Las Velas, a small restaurant on top of island (4,010 meters high) run by a gourmet chef. \n                             \n                               There was no light in the restaurant, just candles; no waiters, only the chef slowly cooking with an old transistor playing in the background. The athmosphere was great but the food itself was divine: our best meal of the trip. By far. The friend who was with me (the other one was sick) ordered the trout cooked in the oven and I have to say it's one of the best I have ever had. I took the steak and it was also very good - tender and with a very fine sauce - but that trout was really something exceptional. After that we talked a bit with the chef and he showed us the stars outside that appeared so brightly in the cloudless night. Quite an evening."},{"Item1":"Days 13-15: La Paz, Bolivia","Item2":"At 10.30 AM we took a boat back to Copacabana. After lunch and a last walk in Copacabana we took a bus to La Paz and arrived in the evening. We stayed at Estrella Andina and had dinner at the Colonial Pot. Food was good for the money but not oustanding.\nThe next day (14), we visited la Iglesia de San Francisco, the old colonial neighborhood and la Plaza Murillo. We also booked our 3-day tour in Uyuni with Oasis tours.\n                             \n                               In the evening of that day we had a very good dinner at La Comédie and went out in a bar/club called La Malegria. It was a nice evening although I have to say altitude, alcohol and food poisoning don't add up well. \nDuring our last day in La Paz we went to visit los Museos Costumbrista, del Litoral Boliviano y la casa de Murillo. In the evening we had dinner in Tambo Colonial before taking a night bus to Uyuni."},{"Item1":"Days 16-18: Uyuni tour, Bolivia","Item2":"The tours of Uyuni are pretty much all the same so I won't go into too much detail. What I can say is that the tour company we picked (Oasis Tours) provided a very good experience. The driver was really friendly and knowledgeable and the places we stayed at were fine. \nThe first day we saw the train cemetery, the Salar of Uyuni and the Isla Incahuasi. The Salar of Uyuni was very impressive although from the pictures I had seen I was expecting something even more stunning.\nThe next day we got up at 4 AM and drove through the rest of the altiplano of Bolivia. We saw Salar de Chiguana, the Volcán ollague (vulcano) and many lagoons with flamingos.\n                             \n                               Finally, we saw the famous Árbol de Piedra and stayed in a place near a magnificent lagoon (Laguna Colorada) with an amazing red colour (and more flamingos).\nOn the last day of the tour we saw volcanic geysers and bathed in thermal waters before driving back to Uyuni through Dali's desert (Desierto Dalí), valle de Rocas and San Cristóbal.\nBack in Uyuni we took a night bus to Sucre."},{"Item1":"Day 19: Sucre, Bolivia","Item2":"We arrived at 3AM in Sucre and checked-in at La Escondida Hostal for a good night sleep.\nThe next day was quite chilled - perfect to recover from the 3 days spent in the car for the Uyuni tour. We started by visiting la Plaza  25 de Mayo and wandered around town since most places were closed until the afternoon.\nWe had lunch in Los Balcones Plaza. The food was not that good but it was saved by the great view on the plaza.\nIn the afternoon we climbed up the city to reach el Convento y iglesia de la Recoleta. Unfortunately, it was closed that day but at least we could admire the panorama of the city.\n                             \n                               We then went back to the center and visited la Catedral and la Casa de la Libertad where we learned that Sucre is the official capital of Bolivia and not La Paz.\nAt sunset we had a walk in el Parque Bolívar. We had dinner at the Joy Ride Café where we had good tacos and a lot of cocktails. We then finished the night in Florin, a very nice bar with the ideal mix between tourists and locals."},{"Item1":"Day 20: Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia","Item2":"We took a plane from Sucre in the morning to avoid another long ride in bus (15 hours). The flight in comparison took us only 30 minutes and costed a bit less than 40 euros. The last day in Santa Cruz was not our happiest of the trip.\nIt was the last one and we were in this city only because of its airport but we tried to make the best of it. The first thing we noticed was the change in climate: Santa Cruz is quite low in comparison to the other places we visited in Bolivia (about 500 meters) so the atmosphere was quite warm and humid.\n                             \n                               To treat ourselves and relax before the long flight home we booked a 4-star hotel with sauna and swimming pool (Urbari Apartment Resort). We had a good lunch in La Republica and after a quick walk in the city center we returned to the hotel to rest.\nFor our last meal of the trip we picked a Swiss restaurant 'Chalet La Suisse' and had quite a good fondue along with a few bottles of white wine. We reminisced about the trip and shared our highlights - good time :)"}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/philippines-itinerary-1-week/","Title":"Philippines 1 Week Itinerary","SubTitle":"The amazing Boracay island, the great metropolis of Manila and the mesmerizing rice terraces in Banaue","Destinations":["Asia","Southeast Asia","Philippines","Boracay"],"Duration":"6 days","Themes":["Backpacker","Beach","Hiking","Nature"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Days 1-3: Boracay, a dream made island","Item2":"Shortly after landing in Manila, we took another flight with Zest Air directly to Boracay (1 hour flight). To be more precise, we landed in Caticlan on the \"mainland\" of Panay island. Then a short boat trip brought us to Boracay, where we found an nice accommodation on the longest beach: the White Beach. This beach is well-known for its white color and the amazing transparency of the water. It is divided in 3 stations that have different kind of accommodations / activities. Station 1 has all the best (and most expensive) hotels, station 2 is the center of the beach and has nice hotels, great restaurants and some interesting places dedicated to nightlife, and station 3 has cheaper options. We stayed in a nice hotel in station 3, and I would definitely recommend it.\n                             \n                               From this location, we were able to enjoy the paradisiac landscapes and environment of the island. Here is what I recommend:\n\nWhite Beach\nWilly's Rock\nThe Bat Cave\n\nRegarding activities, we really enjoyed snorkeling around the Crocodile Island. We joined a group of divers, as this location is usually not for snorkeling but for scuba diving. You have to be careful as currents can be strong, but this is definitely worth it! There are tons of fishes. However, I found the corals not so great in comparison to previous snorkeling sessions in Bali, Indonesia."},{"Item1":"Day 4: THE BAYSIDE CAPITAL: MANILA","Item2":"Our Philippines trip then took us back in the capital, Manila. A lot is being said about tourism in Manila and let me say it clearly: you SHOULD visit this city if you intend to go in the Philippines! You'll read that it is dangerous, dodgy, or all kind of alarming things, but no way you miss it if you want to feel the pulse of the country! Manila is a crowded, noisy and colorful Asian metropolis, which hides a lot of great locations, monuments, and sightseeings. We really appreciated the Intramuros fortified area and the Rizal Park at the end of the afternoon. People go there to walk, discuss and play; a peaceful atmosphere will surround you and give you some rest in comparison to the other parts of the city\n                             \n                               What we actually did:\n\nFort Santiago\nIntramuros\nCasa Manila\nRizal Park"},{"Item1":"Days 5-6: THE AMAZING RICE TERRACES IN BANAUE","Item2":"We took a night bus leaving at 10pm from Manila and arriving in 7am in Banaue. Most of the people come in Banaue to visit the amazing rice terraces, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and considered as the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\"! We dedicated 2 full days to it and we never regretted this decision! I would even say that you need 3 to 4 days if you want to do everything well without rushing.\nWe stayed at the B&amp;B Banaue Homestay, where we really had a very good time: friendly people, good rooms and great guiding services! We spent the first day visiting the little town and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of our B&amp;B, when we were not dreaming while looking at the great landscapes surrounding us. This is really mesmerizing... We had lunch at the Sanafe Lodge &amp; Restaurant, where you eat in a wide veranda with great views over the town and the rice terraces. Don't miss it!\n                             \n                               On the second day, our B&amp;B had organized us a full day trek around Banaue, in the rice terraces. We had an amazing time and our guide was able to share with us a great depth of details about their construction and their use. We had good hiking shoes that are definitely needed when you walk along the terraces."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/vietnam-trip-backpacking-2-weeks/","Title":"Vietnam Trip: Explore the Country&#8217;s Natural Wonders and Unique Heritage","SubTitle":"Highlights include: Hanoi, Halong Bay Cruise, Sapa Trekking, Hue and Hội An","Destinations":["Asia","Southeast Asia","Vietnam"],"Duration":"10 days","Themes":["Backpacker","Culture","Hiking"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Day 1-2: Hanoi","Item2":"Hanoi, a great starting point for a Vietnam trip\nFlying from Singapore, we arrived in Hanoi by the end of the afternoon after a 3 hours and something flight. This was the start of our Vietnam Trip :) We were rapidly caught by the frenzy atmosphere that characterize Hanoi and which is very contagious! An explosion of different colors, perfumes, ambiances...\nWe found a nice hotel and went for a walk nearby. We lost ourselves in the tiny streets of Hanoi and finally found a small restaurant where no one spoke English.\n                             \n                               After a funny, sign-only discussion, we managed to order a dish with chicken, pointing our finger at the (dead) animal! The meal was delicious and the place very typical.\nThe next day, we woke up early to visit the Vietnamese capital. Each area of the city is dedicated to a specific economic activity: metallurgists, wood carvers, artists, high-tech specialists... Get (not too) lost! We also visited some of the key monuments such as Tay Dang Communal House and Phu Dong Temple."},{"Item1":"Day 3-4: Halong Bay Cruise","Item2":"Halong Bay Cruise\nWe started early the 2nd day - 8am - to reach quickly Ha Long. Arriving at 12:30 pm at the boat station, we embarked on a traditional boat that has around 10 rooms and started the magical Halong Bay Cruise in the Ha Long Bay. Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage site and it is easy to understand why!\n                             \n                               Breathless is the adjective that I would use to describe the feeling we all had facing this incredible scenery! We spent the night onboard and enjoyed really great food for lunch, dinner, and breakfast. We made several stops to visit caves and deserted beaches. We even climbed one the peaks to admire the sunset... What a memory! We definitely recommed doing the Halong Bay Cruise, even if it has become a giant touristic attraction...\nYou'll find a great deal of information about the cruise here: http://www.travelfish.org/feature/77"},{"Item1":"Day 5: Tam Cốc-Bích Động","Item2":"Tam Cốc-Bích Động\nAfter getting off the boat by the end of the morning, we started our journey to Ninh Binh (4 hours by car and around 180km distance).

They're truly comfortable. We reached Lao Cai at 5.30 am where we were welcomed by our guide and transferred to Sapa.\nOur trekking adventure in the mountains and rice terraces was now ready to begin! The first leg was to go to the CAC CAC village, before heading to the SINCHAI village (6km further by foot). We discovered the authentic lifestyle of the Hmong tribe, a very enriching experience. We spent the night in the village with our hosts who served us a delicious dinner with local rice alcohol... That's what I call a Vietnam trip!\n                             \n                               The next morning, we woke up early and march to the Tavan and Jiang Tachai villages, where the Dao rouge tribe lives. Again, we spent the night there with nice hosts.\nThe third day was dedicated to te return to Sapa, where we finally had enough time to visit this nice town. We enjoyed a short excursion to the mountain pass of TRAM TOM (the border between Laocai and Laichau). A short visits to Taphin village, and we went back to Laocai for our train back to Hanoi (night in the train)."},{"Item1":"Day 10: Hanoi - Hue","Item2":"Hanoi - Hue\nArriving very early at Hanoi (4.30 am), we transferred with a domestic flight and flew to Hue - capital city of Thừa Thiên–Huế Province.

Our first vision of the city was the south with its declining industrial boroughs.

Those fishing villages reminded us the coast in Brittany.

In a nutshell, a very nice city with a long-standing history and royal buildings!\nRight after St Andrews, we left the inhabited areas to finally discover the Highlands. Our goal was to make it to Breamar, the sport station of the Highlands, before the night. That's what we did and eventually got some rest!"},{"Item1":"Day 3: Inverness - Loch Ness - Fort Augustus","Item2":"The next day was the day we finally were to met with Nessy..! Waking up early, we drove and discovered majestic Scottish landscapes full of fall colors. Our goal was to reach Inverness that gives access to the Caledonian furrow, in which the world-famous Loch Ness lies. Warning: journeys in car can be pretty long in the Highlands! However, thanks to the road trip  we saw gorgeous and odd countryside landscapes: dense forests from which you emerge only to witness entirely tree-less plateaus, only covered with heath. Owning a Routard guide or good-quality maps is a real advantage for tourism in Scotland, especially in the Highlands, otherwise you may miss some marvelous lochs with  intriguing castle partly in ruins...No worry regarding roads, they all are very well maintained!\n                             \n                               Arriving in Inverness, we were glad to quickly find the famous \"Leakey's Second-hand Bookshop\": an amazing place where you will enjoy a delicious lunch - before getting lost in the thousand of books surrounding you.\nAfter this pleasant stop, we headed for Fort Augustus on the other side of the Loch Ness! Making it by the end of the afternoon, we just had time to book the diner before rushing to our hostel a bit further on the banks of the Loch... We were ready to taste the national dish: Haggis (rumen of stuffed sheep). We found it pretty special and quite strong, but in the end it's good! Back at the hostel, it was time to quietly seat on the shore and watch the tiny waves on the loch... What a feeling!"},{"Item1":"Day 4: Ben Nevis - Oban - Inveraray - Glasgow","Item2":"It was then time to head for the west coast. On the road we kept on enjoying great views on lochs and te Ben Nevis, the highest summit in the UK (1,344m), but that was unfortunately the most rainy day we had during our trip... We had to let go our hiking projects! We decided to drive straight to Oban. We saw a few castle in ruins on the road  and even visited one (THE thing you must absolutely do in Scotland). When arrived in Oban, we discovered a charming town lighten by a colorful sky (the weather changes very rapidly there).\n                             \n                               At first we found the Oban Coliseum a bit weird. This replica from Roma's coliseum is located on the heights of Oban. It was built by a successful local man who wanted to keep local men employed during hard times in the region. Once you're up there, you'll admire an awesome view on the bay and the town. Don't miss it! It was then time for us to head south. We stopped once again at Inveraray: a small village completely lost on the side of a loch.\nWe finally made it back to Glasgow at our hostel for a nice rest before our last day... Edinburgh!"},{"Item1":"Day 5: Edinburgh","Item2":"Edinburgh, capital of Scotland... A very touristic city that enjoy a high reputation whether about culture, education or business! We drove straight to a parking below the castle and bought our (pricy) tickets. Edinburgh Castle is Scotland most-visited attraction and offers a gorgeous view all over the city. From one side the old town, and in the other the shiny new districts. \n                             \n                               The castle has several museums that give you a hint of the eventful history of the country. A must do! We then had lunch in the restaurant where Harry Potter was born: The Elephant House. They serve decent food and have awesome coffee and tea. We then had only time to see the Queen residence when she comes to Scotland, before hitting again the road to Glasgow for the end of the trip and the return to France."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/haruki-murakami-mystical-japan-itinerary/","Title":"Haruki Murakami&#8217;s Mystical Japan","SubTitle":"In the footsteps of the novelist's characters","Destinations":["Asia","East Asia","Japan","Hokkaido","Sapporo","Kobe","Kochi","Kyoto","Osaka","Takamatsu","Tokyo"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Books","Legendary","Spiritual"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Tokyo","Item2":"Most of the characters in Haruki Murakami's novels go through Tokyo at some point.

Arriving in Étretat, we could not park in the city center as the main parking was already full and had to go to the one above the city, about 10 minutes away by foot. By then, the weather had magically improved and we started to see rays of sunlight piercing the clouds as we were walking in the tiny streets to approach the seaside.\nExploring Étretat\nAs first-timers in Étretat, we found the city's architecture and atmosphere fabulous and were amazed by the dramatic landscapes surrounding the town. Facing the sea, you see on each side the impressive (and world-famous) cliffs that stretch for kilometers. Étretat really found the perfect nest! We first decided, before lunch, to explore the north cliff on the right side when you face the sea. Hiking up to the top, you get a bigger view of the stunning landscape: the beautiful town, the impressive cliffs, the natural arches, the pointed \"needle\" and the majestic sea... At the top of the cliff, there is a nice little church and many tourists taking (selfies as well as a few) pictures of the landscape... We took a few pictures and started to hike on the top of the cliff for a few kilometers. At some points, you're even able to go down sometimes to the sea level. Amazing shots can be taken, don't forget to take a good camera with you!\n                             \n                               Lunch in town\nAfter this walk, we went back to Étretat and started our search for a nice restaurant to have lunch. Getting a little lost in the tiny streets, we checked out places on TripAdvisor as we wanted to avoid disappointment... Thanks to the site we found this awesome (and highly-rated) crêperie just a little bit further, but away from the big tourist spots like the beach front. The crêperie itself is called the LANN-BIHOUE and serve simple yet stunning galettes. We were not disappointed and would recommend this place to anyone!\nSunny afternoon\nOur afternoon was dedicated to the south cliff, which is on the left side when you face the sea. Luck was definitely with us when the clouds disappeared and the sun made a gorgeous apparition to highlight the cliff and create beautiful colors both on the sea and the cliffs. Similarly to our morning schedule, once up there, we kept on walking further to explore a bit the path and enjoy the spectacular views over the sea."},{"Item1":"Days 1-2: Honfleur, Normandy","Item2":"Off to Honfleur\nLeaving Étretat at 5pm, we took the car and headed towards Honfleur, around 45 Kms south. We enjoyed a very nice drive with the sunset and great colors in the fields around. One of the impressive moments is when you take the Normandy Bridge, a cable-stayed road bridge that spans the river Seine linking Le Havre to Honfleur. The bridge held the record for the longest distance between piers for any cable-stayed bridge in the world, but lost it in 1999.\nWe arrived in Honfleur just before 6pm and parked the car. We had booked in advance a nice Airbnb near the old, picturesque port, which is the key tourist attraction of the town. \n                             \n                               We decided to go out for dinner at the exact same time as the rain came back. Without umbrella, but with a solid motivation, we started to look for a cosy place for dinner. We found La Tortue, a French specialty restaurant in the \"rue de l'Homme de Bois\" street. We had a very good time and found the food as well as the wines excellent. Prices are a bit high for the region, but still much cheaper to what you would find in Paris.\nAfter a good night of sleep, we woke up and found a very sunny day waiting for us. We started to explore the town and walked around the old port and the tiny streets around. We had coffee and a light breakfast. With a great view on the beautiful sailing ships, there is no possibly better way to start your day!\nWe then visited a few shops to buy regional products."},{"Item1":"Day 2: Deauville, Normandie","Item2":"Driving to the Queen of the Norman beaches\nWe left Honfleur at 11:30 am and drove the 20 kms towards Deauville. The drive is very pleasant as you cross typical villages on the way and arrive from the top, overlooking Deauville and Trouville. Famous for its casinos and the beautiful houses facing the sea, Deauville stands out as a key destination for Parisians willing to escape the frenzyness of the capital. It is considered as one of the most prestigious seaside resorts in France.\n                             \n                               We had lunch at a restaurant not far away from the beach. Not as nice as the 2 other restaurants we visited previously, but still really good.\nWe then spent the afternoon walking in the city, on the beach and near the port of Trouville. This village of fishermen that borders Deauville is a well-known tourist spot in Normandy.\nWe left Deauville at 4 pm to head back to Paris and avoid the awful traffic jams that often occur on Sunday afternoons."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/interstellar-filming-locations-iceland-2014/","Title":"Interstellar filming locations: defying the laws of physics in Iceland","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["North America","Canada","Alberta","United States","Iceland"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Legendary","Movies"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Alien planet surface","Item2":"Eldhraun lava field, Orrustuhóll, Southern Region, Iceland\nLocated near Kirkjubaejarklaustur in Iceland, Eldhraun is an impressive lava field that was created during one of the largest and most destructive eruptions in the history of mankind that lasted from 1783 to 1784.

You need 1/2 day for the Brazilian side and 1 day for the Argentinian side.\nBoth are really beautiful but we preferred the Argentinian side because we could take a boat and go on the river very close to the falls.

I didn’t think it was that hard so I guess anyone could do it.\nThe first day is the way up to Pedra do Sino (2 263m). You start the trek from Teresopolis which is 1 000m high. As you can see, there’s a significant height difference but it’s totally doable. When we were at the top of the mountain, we saw clouds all around us which made us fell like we were on the top of the world! Wonderful sight! The sunset was amazing.

It’s really impressive but bring earplugs!\nOnce every 2 weeks, the most famous drum band in Salvador gives a concert. The band is called Olodum (they’re the ones from Michael Jackson’s « They don’t care about us » video).

You have to carry your backpack with around 10kg of clothes, sleeping bag, food and so on and the trail can be very steep (you even have to climb a few meters of rock from time to time).

The tides were described by Victor Hugo as shifting 'à la vitesse d'un cheval au galop' (as swiftly as a galloping horse) and that's not exaggerated at all: the tide comes in at the speed of 1 meter per second!\nNeedless to say a guide is mandatory for safety reasons, not only not to be caught by the tide but also to avoid quicksands that are common on the way. You can easily find a tour departing from Saint-Jean-le-Thomas. You should plan this in advance though as you need to follow tide times.\n                             \n                               Whether you reached Mont Saint-Michel by car or by walking you will be equally rewarded by the sight of this beautiful fortified island dating back to the Middle Ages.\nThe Mont Saint-Michel can be visited thoroughly in a few hours. Be prepared to climb quite a few stairs, especially to reach the Abbey at the top that is a must-see. After that enjoy a meal at the world-famous restaurant La Mère Poulard visited by many famous people through the years like Ernest Hemingway who spent a few days there to write up his notes on the D-Day landings. A bit too expensive in our opinion but the omelet there and the experience in general certainly won't disappoint you.\nThen spend the night in one of the many guest houses/B&amp;Bs in the surrounding area (in Beauvoir, for example) and explore further the Mont Saint-Michel Bay before returning to Paris the next day for the end of this Normandy 4-day road trip. Hope you enjoy, don't forget to send us your pictures!"}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/pulp-fiction-filming-locations-itinerary-los-angeles/","Title":"Pulp Fiction filming locations and itinerary in Los Angeles","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["North America","United States","California","Los Angeles"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Legendary","Movies","Urban"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny scene at the diner","Item2":"Hawthorne Grill, 13763 Hawthorne Boulevard, Hawthorne, Los Angeles\nPulp Fiction starts with Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), a couple of petty criminals, discussing how it became too dangerous to rob liquor stores and the likes nowadays.

The start of our 3 days in Paris was focused on top sightseeing spots. At the train station we bought a 3-day metro ticket at the kiosk (cash, credit cards but no Amex). The ticket saved us a lot of money, as metro is the most efficient way to get around in Paris. If you’re an experienced cyclist, you can rent a Velib bike just about anywhere, but you need to know the city pretty well.\nWe were staying at the Hotel de Saint-Germain on Rue du Four right next to the Sèvres - Babylone and Saint-Sulpice metro stations. Considering the superb location, this 3-star hotel was cheap, neat and friendly, storing our luggage before check-in and ordering us a cheap taxi to the airport later. If you want your own room in a great location for a reasonable price - it’s perfect.\nLe Bon Marché\nAfter the hotel, we started our Paris itinerary with the world’s first ever department store - a temple of luxury Bon Marché to pick our Louvre tickets. Order the tickets online to skip the queue on one of the official websites such as Fnac or Ticketweb. You cannot print tickets yourself, so you need to pick them up.\nLe Bon Marché is a benchmark department store, famous for its iconic architectural staircase. There are many things to enjoy there even if you don’t plan on dropping lots of cash - like the beauty hall on the ground floor for a little lipstick delight or a food department abundant with mouthwatering French produce, patisserie, charcuterie and wine.\nNotre-Dame\nAfter Le Bon Marché we walked all the way to the Notre-Dame through the beautiful Saint-Germain neighborhood. We had to cross the Seine to get to the Île de la Cité, where the cathedral is located. Notre-Dame is an engrossing experience, especially if you’re a fan of Dumas or Hugo novels. Make sure to get a view of the church from the left bank to see it in its full glory. Once inside, have a look overhead for the amazing architecture.\nAfternoon\nFrom Notre-Dame we walked along the right bank to Louvre. Walking along the Seine is a scenic must-do, especially for the historical Pont Neuf Bridge. Within the Louvre, we went straight to the Italian Renaissance hall and the Mona Lisa room. Hold your belongings well in that one.\nThen we checked the Louis XIV rooms, which are a new addition to the museum. The Napoleon III apartments are also notable, preserved in their original state.\n                             \n                               Strasbourg Saint-Denis\nIf you’re eager to have a proper French lunch in a brasserie, make sure to go between 12:30-14:00. Most brasseries and bistros are closed before and after until 19.00. Research in advance for “service continu” places if you want to eat outside these hours. We didn’t do any restaurant research, so we had to improvise. We found a place in Strasbourg Saint-Denis, which is a multicultural neighbourhood slowly gentrified with hip eateries. However, the place only served light tapas and we were pretty hungry. So we ended up going to the Grands Boulevards (which is also a nice area to hang out) to one of the chain restaurants.\nOpéra\nWalking from Grands Boulevards, we went to see the Opéra Garnier, a beautiful symbol of the Belle Epoque. The walk from Opéra to Place Vendôme with a statue of Danton is definitely worthwhile. This is where the society of luxury originated in Paris with many first jewellery stores, including Cartier.\nTour Eiffel\nWe took the metro to the Bir-Hakeim for the Tour Eiffel. After enjoying close-up views, we went to Champ de Mars to chill in the greenery and watch street dancers and skaters who often perform there. This area is full of street Eiffel Tower sellers, but they are not too intrusive.\nEvening\nChamps-Elysées, Lido and Ladurée\nWe had a cabaret show booked at Lido for 21:00 as my friend was eager to see a real French cabaret. The Lido show is quite theatrical and technologically scenographic with lots of effects, including an ice show. However, for a more cutting-edge and provocative cabaret, go to Crazy Horse. Before Lido we quickly went to Ladurée (which was completely full) to have a quick coffee with macarons. The Arc de Triomphe is also visible from there, you can climb inside for a fee.\nLes Deux Magots\nAt about 12AM we ended up in the famous café Les Deux Magots, where the likes of Sartre, Hemingway and Picasso used to hang out. This is one of the most famous cafés in Paris, now overpriced but still romantic to enjoy a summer midnight."},{"Item1":"Day 2: Indulging in Parisian Art de Vivre","Item2":"Saint-Germain and Pierre Hermé\nNext morning, we got up early and went to Pierre Hermé on rue Bonaparte - an iconic French confectionary with artisanal macarons and pastry. I’d definitely recommend it over Ladurée - the flavors are much more exquisite and sophisticated. We had the famous rose petal croissants, passion fruit chocolate macarons and even a tart for breakfast! Along the way, we passed a couple of unique concept stores in the Saint-Germain area, including Hedi Slimane’s Saint Laurent flagship and Patrick Roger chocolate concept store.\nPère Lachaise\nWe took the metro to Gambetta to visit the Père Lachaise cemetery. It is an ethereal outdoor experience, where you can reflect on life in absolute serenity. The cemetery is big and full of hills, so if you plan to visit a lot of graves, prepare accordingly. We saw the Jim Morrison gravestone, Edith Piaf, Modigliani and the infamous Oscar Wilde tomb. After taking metro to Bastille, we had a traditional Côte de Bœuf with red wine in a homey French brasserie, Chez Paul.\n                             \n                               Afternoon/evening\nOrsay\nThe Musee D’Orsay is not open on Monday, so we spent the Sunday afternoon there exploring the most comprehensive collection of French Impressionists. This is my favorite museum for its amazing architecture, unique exhibitions and a bookstore rich with great art books and criticism publications.\nLe Marais\nThe trendiest area of Paris, Le Marais, is the beating heart/ hipster central of contemporary Parisian culture. Buzzing with ever-changing pop-ups and cutting-edge boutiques, this neighbourhood is great for people watching and shopping. You can also enjoy the best éclair in the city at L’éclair de Génie. The area has lots of gourmet street food, including some of the best falafels in Paris. While waiting for our dinner at nearby Café Des Musées, we went to a beautiful park of the Lycée Général Victor Hugo with free Wi-Fi. The park lifestyle in the summer is amazing in Paris, with plenty of spaces to relax in nature."},{"Item1":"Day 3: exploring the city without a plan","Item2":"Morning\nMontmartre\nMonday morning was reserved for Montmartre, which was the main setting of the Amélie movie, also famous for Art Deco and street painters. After climbing the hill, we visited Basilica Sacré-Cœur bustling with tourists. On the way to Place de Tertre (where street painters work all day), we were lucky to witness a live band performance. Hungry and tired, we had lunch at Maison Rose - quite romantic and beautiful venue with decent food. As we didn't research the restaurant scene well, we had to eat ad hoc, so I recommend planning your dining venues in advance to enjoy French food to the max!\nMoulin Rouge and Barbès\nWhile in the 18th district, we quickly went to see the Moulin Rouge and also walked around the infamous Barbès Rochechouart station (notorious for cat-calling, illegal ticket sales etc. - can be intimidating at night). Ironically, this area is now getting gentrified with new hip bars, shops and restaurants. The Barbès market is also worth visiting during the day for ethnic produce and spices.\n                             \n                               Afternoon\nChâtelet – Les Halles\nI was eager to go to the Unkut store of the famous French rapper Booba in Châtelet. Booba is one of the greatest French hip-hop talents, especially notable for the song Le Crime Paie with Lunatic. Today he lives in Miami, sings in auto tune about his muscles and money, but also has a pretty funky fashion line Unkut that combines street wear with 21st century glamor (store located in Châtelet).\nBeaubourg and Centre Georges Pompidou\nWe walked from Châtelet to Centre Georges Pompidou - a wacky Post-modernist building that hosts a nice collection of 20th century modern art (with contemporary art exhibitions now and then). Nearby we had a famous flower shaped ice-cream at Amorino, which provided a great foodstagramming opportunity. The Beaubourg area is notable for street dancing, and we were lucky to enjoy an amazing street performance by an emerging dance crew. Sadly, this was the last experience of our trip, as we had to rush to the airport."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/hiking-iceland-2-weeks-itinerary/","Title":"Hiking Iceland in 2 weeks by the LegendaryTrips&#8217; team","SubTitle":"Highlights: Skógar/Landmannalaugar, Westfjords","Destinations":["Capital Region","Southern Region","Westfjords","Iceland"],"Duration":"16 days","Themes":["Backpacker","Classic","Hiking","Nature"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Day 1: Reykjavic","Item2":"We arrived in Reykjavic late at night on Thursday. We were so excited that instead of going to bed we went to the city centre to have a first glimpse of Reykjavic. It was also the perfect occasion to experience the famous midnight sun of Iceland.\nOn the following day (Friday), our real first day, we bought food and the equipment we were missing for the trek from Skógar to Landmannalaugar starting the next day (note: we will write a detailed blog post on the equipment we used and missed during our treks).\n                             \n                               Once this sorted, we explored the main attractions of Reykjavic like the Laugavegur street and the Lutheran church of Hallgrímskirkja (see photo). We also went to the strange Perlan building – sort of a large dome perched on huge water tanks – where we could admire a beautiful panorama of Reykjavic.\nAfter that we crossed the surrounding woods to reach the Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach for a good cold swim followed by a bath in the hot geothermal pool. Finally, in the evening we had a great burger with Iceland beers at the Vegamót restaurant before sleeping at the Bus Hostel. We were ready to start the hiking piece of this trip to Iceland in 2 weeks!"},{"Item1":"Day 2: Skógar to Landmannalaugar trek Leg 1 → Skógar","Item2":"On Saturday we took the bus at 8:00 from the BSÍ bus terminal to Skógar for the start of our first long awaited trek in Iceland: the vulcano hike from Skógar to Þórsmörk followed by the most famous hiking trail in Iceland from Þórsmörk to Landmannalaugar in the southern part of Iceland's Highlands.\nWe arrived in Skógar at 11:00 and started the hike almost right after. The way was mostly uphill all along and we quickly felt the weight of our near-20kg backpacks. After about 3 hours our morale was severely hurt when we saw a sign indicating we weren't even halfway while we were seriously thinking being close to Fimmvörðuháls.\nFinally at around 18:00 we reached Fimmvörðuháls, just near the famous vulcano Eyjafjallajökull that erupted in 2010 and paralysed most of the European flight traffic.\n                             \n                               There we enjoyed a beautiful evening with a sunny and clear blue sky. We were even allowed by the hut warden to camp in Fimmvörðuháls although it's normally not possible due to the altitude and openness of the site that makes it vulnerable to wind and rain.\nSome people actually go straight to Þórsmörk but in our opinion it would have been a bit too much without starting early in the morning from Skógar.\nNote that there's no water in Fimmvörðuháls so be sure to take enough with you if you plan to spend the night there. Another (safe) option is to drink melted snow. You also need to take your trash with you."},{"Item1":"Day 3: Skógar to Landmannalaugar trek Leg 2 → Fimmvörðuháls to Þórsmörk (Thórsmörk)","Item2":"We got up quite late (around 10:00; everyone else was already gone except the hut warden) and continued the trek to Þórsmörk. On the way we could have a close look at the surrounding vulcanos, which were quite stunning, although it was quite foggy when we were there.\nAs we started to go down the trail the sky opened up and it was sunny all the rest of the way, which at some point really made us feel like we were taking a walk in the Alps.\n                             \n                               It tooks us about 4 hours in total to reach the hut in Þórsmörk (Langidalur) so we had quite some time there in the afternoon and evening to chill and rest.\nIn Þórsmörk it's possible to take a shower for 500 ISK and you can dispose of your trash."},{"Item1":"Day 4: Skógar to Landmannalaugar trek Leg 3 → Þórsmörk (Thórsmörk) to Emstrur/Botnar","Item2":"The next day didn't start well at all: there were very strong winds and rain so the warden was advising not to continue our trek. To quote her: 'I cannot forbid you to go but I strongly discourage you to do so'.\nThe weather was supposed to get worse in the upcoming days so we were likely to be stuck for a while before being able to continue which would have disturbed our entire schedule. We stayed until the beginning of the afternoon pondering what we should do.\nWe first thought of taking a bus to Landmannalaugar and do day hikes from there but we were really not happy with this solution.\nAt some point the weather got better and we were seeing that some people were actually going on the trail, so we also decided to try our luck out there.\nThe way to Emstrur/Botnar was actually not that bad, although towards the end we faced some strong winds and a bit of rain before reaching the hut. There we were lucky to get the last two spots available, which certainly saved us from a terrible night of camping.\n                             \n                               We also had to cross a large ford with a bit of current. We take this occasion to give an advice on equipment: do not forget to take sandals with you! Crossing fords barefoot was a very painful experience for us in Iceland and also a risky one as it's easy to trip and fall in the water.\nLastly, a word about the wardens' recommendations in Iceland: we got the feeling that they try to discourage people from going as much as possible whenever the weather is uncertain (which is almost all the time in Iceland since weather can change drastically in just a few hours). We are not hot heads but back in Þórsmörk we really felt the weather was getting better and after discussing extensively our options with the hut warden she admitted it was probably fine to go provided we had the right equipment (i.e. good hiking shoes and rainproof clothes).\nSo follow the wardens' recommendations but make sure the conditions are really as bad as they say they are before cancelling your journey."},{"Item1":"Day 5: Skógar to Landmannalaugar trek leg 4 →  Emstrur/Botnar to Alftavatn","Item2":"The weather was getting worse in Emstrur/Botnar and the wardens were announcing a storm around 15:00 so we tried to leave early to arrive in Alftavatn before hell would break loose.\nAgain the wardens tried to discourage us, but all the other travelers were continuing the trek so we decided to do the same. The way was mostly flat so it didn't take us too long (about 4 hours) to reach the next hut located just next to lake Alftavatn.\n                             \n                               The main difficulty of this part of the trek was the multiple fords to cross (about 3 or 4), including one with a very strong current. We were luckily helped by guides to cross it but we can imagine it would have been very difficult otherwise, especially without sandals!\nTo add to our luck we found places available in the Alftavatn hut. We first planned to camp there but really didn't feel like it due to the weather.\nNote that a night in a hut costs about 42 EUR / 58 USD per person per night so it can quickly get expensive."},{"Item1":"Day 6: Skógar to Landmannalaugar trek Leg 5 → Alftavatn to Landmannalaugar through Hrafntinnusker","Item2":"On the fifth day of our trek we left Alftavatn early (around 8:00) in order to reach the final destination, Landmannalaugar, in one go instead of staying in Hrafntinnusker for the night. The weather was really bad with a lot of wind and rain and, on top of that, we had to cross a lot of places with snow.\nAs a result we were soaked wet when we reached Hrafntinnusker around 12:00 (including the interior of my shoes which was very unpleasant). We stayed in the hut to have some rest and dry up a bit before finishing our trek. We had to pay 300 ISK per person to be able to enter the hut and use the facilities to cook lunch.\nAt 13:30 we went back on the trail under better weather conditions which allowed us to admire the beautiful landscapes of Landmannalaugar. Mountains with stones of all colours, green, brown, even pink, fumaroles all around interspersed with icy rivers: yes, this part between Hrafntinnusker and Landmannalaugar is undoubtedly the most beautiful of the trek. It's also the easiest for hikers like us going opposite to the traditional way (to Landmannalaugar instead of from) as it is the one part where you actually descend instead of going up.\n                             \n                               We arrived at the Landmannalaugar camping site around 16:00 which gave us some time to rest and enjoy the wonderful geothermal hot springs. The camp had quite a nice store where we were able to buy all kind of nice food to celebrate the completion of the trek! At the same time we felt a bit sad as we were realizing what a wonderful adventure we had just lived and that it was now over. This impression was reinforced by the many travelers who were about to start their trek the following day. But we quickly cheered up as we looked forward to the next part of our journey: Skaftafell!"},{"Item1":"Days 7-9: Skaftafell glacier (Vatnajökull National Park)","Item2":"The day after arriving in Landmannalaugar we took a bus at 15:30 to Skaftafell (Vatnajökull National Park). The ride was not cheap to say the least: about 60 EUR / 80 USD. We arrived in Skaftafell at 20:30 and registered ourselves at the camping.\nThere are many hiking routes around the Skaftafell from 4 to 30 km (2.5 to 20 mi) round-trip. You can find all of the routes on this page.\nThe following day (Friday) we hiked the trail to Morsárjökull (Morsá glacier) where the largest avalanche in Iceland since 1967 happened in the winter of 2006-07. The weather was sunny and the walk pretty easy in comparison of the Landmannalaugar trek although it was about 20 km (12.4 mi) round-trip.\n                             \n                               On the following day we already had our bus back to Reykjavic at 12:30 and were planning to get up early but ended up waking up at 9:30. We rushed out on the uphill hiking trail that leads to a beautiful view over Skaftafell glacier which is about 6.5 km (3.7 mi) round-trip.\nOnce on top we just had a bit of time to enjoy the beautiful spectacle and take a few photos (that you can see in the photo gallery dedicated to this trip) before literally running back to the camp to pack all our stuff."},{"Item1":"Day 10: Reykjavic and Blue Lagoon","Item2":"After a long but pleasant bus ride on Saturday through the coast of south Iceland we were back in Reykjavic where we stayed at the lovely guest house of Monika Blondal not far from the city centre. We had dinner at one of the only restaurants still open at 23:30: Meze on Laugavegur.\nOn Sunday we booked our flight tickets to the Westfjords, which like everything else in Iceland was pretty expensive (about 250 EUR / 340 USD for a return trip to Ísafjörður) and, before you ask: no, it's not possible to go to the Westfjords by bus (at least not when we were there).\nIn the afternoon we took a bus from from the BSÍ bus terminal to the famous Blue Lagoon. I don't know exactly how it's done but the Blue Lagoon is the one thing you see everywhere when you start researching your trip to Iceland and naturally you book it in advance expecting a thousand and one wonders.\n                             \n                               Personally my experience was very different: first of all, although beautiful, the place is much smaller than what the pictures let you think and is crowded with literally hundreds of people. The water is extremely warm (about 40 °C / 100 °F) which is pleasant for some time but not for hours. Don't get us wrong: the experience is interesting but we feel that 40 EUR (54 USD) excluding the bus to go there is a bit too much for what it really is. In comparison we had a much better time at the geothermal hot springs in Landmannalaugar surrounded with beautiful mountains instead of massive building structure that looks like your local swimming pool.\nTo finish the day we had good Indian food with local fish at Kryddlegin Hjortu before tasting some very good Icelandic beers at Micro Bar."},{"Item1":"Day 11 [Westfjords]: Ísafjörður","Item2":"We had a pretty chilled day on the Monday of our second and last week in Iceland. In the morning we went to the supermarket to buy food for the trek in Hornstrandir Nature Reserve in the Westfjords. At lunch we went to Sjávarbarinn, a fish restaurant that serves a good and cheap lunch buffet in the harbour area of Reykjavic.\nAfter another stroll on the marina and through the city we went to Reykjavic Domestic Airport to take our flight to Ísafjörður at 18:30. The process was pretty easy: check-in half an hour before departure, no security check and a flying time of about 45 minutes.\n                             \n                               We were really wowed when we descended from the plane by the beautiful and unusual scenery of Ísafjörður: the city is in between tall black and green mountains that have a surface so flat it looks polished. Although the altitude is not that high, the clouds descend very low and cover city and mountains like fog.\nWe had dinner in a wonderful restaurant on the port named Tjöruhúsið that serves some of the best fish we have ever eaten. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet that costs 5,000 ISK per person but it's definitely worth it, with about ten different fishes, side dishes and a delicious fish soup. We spent the night at the Managisting Guesthouse."},{"Item1":"Day 12 [Westfjords]: Hornstrandir Nature Reserve - Aðalvík to Hælavík through Hesteyri","Item2":"We got up early in order to be at the office of Westtours at 8:00 and book the boat to Aðalvík in Hornstrandir Nature Reserve departing at 9:00 from Ísafjörður. We were quite lucky to be able to go at all since it was only the second day that boats resumed going to Hornstrandir. Before that the weather conditions were so bad that it wasn't possible. The employee of Westtours was very nice and helped us planned our itinerary to make sure we could see as many spots as possible while being able to take a boat back on Friday (for some destinations the boat only come once or twice a week so it's important to be careful – check here for the full schedule).\nWe arrived around 11:00 in Aðalvík and started hiking under a light rain and grey sky towards Hesteyri. The first thing that stroke us was that although we had a map it wasn't very easy to orientate. The beginning of the way was not marked at all but luckily there were hikers ahead of us going to the same place so we followed them. We first had a few fords to cross and then climbed to go through some mountains.  For a long time there was no clear trail but only cairns to orientate and the way was full of sharp stones, which were tricky to walk on. We arrived a bit before 15:00 in Hesteyri and had a generous lunch: a cereal bar and a few dates (pretty much the same lunch diet as in Landmannalaugar).\n                             \n                               We were tempted to stay in Hesteyri for the night but the employee of Westtourds had planned something else for us: we had to get to Hælavík that same day in order to be on schedule for the return boat on Friday at Veiðileysufjörður. So we headed back on the trail (or the lack there of). We immediately had to cross a ford and then climb a very sharp snowy mountain pass. We only made it to the top by carefully planting our feet in the snow. After that was we had to go up a bit further to reach the end of the Hesteyri fjord. Then it was a long, very long, way down to Hælavík. We cursed a few times at the employee of Westtours for advising such a lengthy way in just one day (about 24 km in total with some elevation to be taken seriously!).\nFinally we arrived on the shore of Hælavík around 22:00. We immediately forgave the Westtours employee when we saw the stunning landscape that awaited us. The sun was already gone so there was this strange yet beautiful dimmed light casting on the cliffs of Hælavík. There were also huge piles of wood logs on the beach that we imagined were from earlier settlements (Hornstrandir used to be inhabited). All this and the fact that we were the only ones there gave us this surreal impression of being at the end of the world. We reached the camping site where there were just two other tents. We quickly planted ours and hungrily ate a full pot of pasta. We even allowed ourselves a bit of luxury and had instant coffee and Oreos for dessert. Before going to sleep we were greeted by an arctic fox walking around between the tents without a care in the world."},{"Item1":"Day 13 [Westfjords]: Hornstrandir Nature Reserve - Hælavík to Hornvik","Item2":"The way to Hornvik was a walk in the park in comparison of the previous day. We left around 11:30 after a good night sleep and arrived at destination around 16:00. Still, we must warn travelers of a dangerous part on the cliff trail before arriving in Hornvik: there's a part where the ridge is broken with a very slippery surface, which makes it very difficult to cross, especially with heavy backpacks. We somehow managed to jump over but this was certainly not a safe option. We saw other hikers reaching the trail from another path above the one we took, so we would advise you to take that one instead: when arriving near Hornvik just try to avoid descending to the shore as much as possible and follow the trail there that will eventually lead you to the coastal trail.\n                             \n                               Hornvik, also known as the King and Queen cliffs because of its very distinctive shape, is certainly the most beautiful place we have seen in Hornstrandir Nature Reserve. However, because of that beauty you kind of miss the whole wild and deserted feeling that you find otherwise in Hornstrandir because of all the people it attracts (there were at least twenty tents). Nonetheless, it was fantastic and we wished we had an extra day to hike the trail on the Hornvik peninsula that takes about 5-6 hours. In the evening we saw an arctic fox walking around with a bird in the mouth. \nWe followed her from a distance and discovered she actually was living under the warden's hut with her cubs (see this photo)."},{"Item1":"Day 14 [Westfjords]: Hornstrandir Nature Reserve - Hornvik to Veiðileysufjörður","Item2":"For our third and last day of hiking in Hornstrandir we had to reach the Veiðileysufjörður fjord where the boat was supposed to take us back to Bolungarvik. The way was very beautiful, especially with the view of Hornvik after climbing. As that's often the case in Iceland, the sun was then fighting to shine through the dense clouds and the result of that battle was an explosion of splendid colors.\nThis is where we took (in our opinion) our most beautiful photos of Iceland.\nA bit less than a couple of hours after leaving Hornvik we reached the mountain pass that was leading to Veiðileysufjörður.\nEverything looked so easy; the fjord was right in front of us and we thought we would be there in an hour and a half at most. After a few steps though we saw a huge wall of snow to descend. Please believe that we are not exaggerating when we say it was almost vertical and 30 m (100 ft) tall.\nWe descended through the right but realized it was way too sharp to continue directly so we continued horizontally instead, carefully planting our feet in the snow and putting the weight of our body and backpack against the slope.\n                             \n                               The feeling was really horrible; at that point we really thought we would fall and hit the rocks below. Each movement had to be precise and was draining our forces. Even worse: we were reaching an area made of ice where it was becoming impossible to safely plant our feet for support. Robin sat down to rest and had the idea to slide down on his butt instead. He slowed down the descent with his feet and made it safely to the bottom. On my end I was too petrified to do the same, although Robin made it look very easy. I continued my painful horizontal climb. I was focused on each of my movements, conscious that any mistake could have the worst consequences. I was in the zone, listening to any signal from my body, even using my knee to be more stable.\nFinally, I made it safely to the rocks on the left. The rest of the way was much easier and we soon arrived to beautiful Veiðileysufjörður. We were the only ones there besides a Belgian hiker who was also taking the boat the next day. The weather was fantastic and we had a great time chilling in the sun while admiring the beautiful landscape of the fjord."},{"Item1":"Days 15-16: Reykjavic/ flight back home","Item2":"The good weather in Veiðileysufjörður did not last though and around midnight we were waken up by very strong winds and rain. The tent was totally folded on one side and for a moment we thought it wouldn't resist the night, especially since these conditions continued all night, but it held good!\nIn the morning the Belgian guy came to tell us he was doubting the boat would come by such weather. We heard of people being stuck in Hornstrandir for three days the week before when the weather was really bad, so we started to worry the same might happen to us.\nThe boat was planned for 10:30 and at 11:00 there was still no one so we got even more worried. Luckily around 11:30 we saw a little dot moving on the water between the two mountains of the fjord: the boat had finally arrived!\n                             \n                               We flew back to Reykjavic in the evening. We were seriously craving for burgers so we went back to Vegamót for dinner. After that we had a few drinks at the Kaffibarinn hoping to see Björk but she wasn't there! We stayed at the Bus Hostel for the night.\nOur final day in Iceland in Reykjavic was a chilled wrap-up of the trip: we bought souvenirs (some famous Icelandic wool pullovers for the misses) and visited the Harpa Concert Hall. In the evening we watched the football games between Netherlands and Brazil for the third place in a bar where we had yet another delicious burger. Early the next day we flew back home, impressed beyond words by the beauty and wilderness of the nature witnessed throughout Iceland."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/into-the-wild-filming-locations-itinerary/","Title":"Into the Wild filming locations and itinerary (2007)","SubTitle":"The true story of Christopher McCandless","Destinations":["North America","United States","Alaska","Cantwell","Denali National Park and Preserve","Stampede Trail","Magic Bus 142","Arizona","Lee&#039;s Ferry","California","Anza-Borrego Desert State Park","Los Angeles","Salton City","Salvation Mountain","Georgia","Atlanta","Hoover Dam","Lake Mead","Nevada","Oregon","Mount Hood","Portland","Reed College","Pacific Crest Trail","South Dakota","Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary","Carthage","Virginia","Washington","Cape Disappointment State Park","Beard&#039;s Hollow","El Golfo de Santa Clara","Mexico"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Backpacker","Books","Hiking","Legendary","Movies","Nature","RoadTrip"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Emory University, Atlanta, Virginia","Item2":"Reed College, 3203 SE Woodstock Blvd, Portland, Oregon\nChristopher McCandless' trip starts at Emory University in Atlanta (Virginia).

After landing in the afternoon, we picked up the rental car (a Peugeot 107, although we were hoping for one of these nice Fiat 500s like we had in Tuscany) and headed to Marinella di Selinunte. This charming seaside town is located in Southeastern Sicily about one hour away from Palermo. The drive was pleasant although we quickly discovered the reckless driving style of Sicilians.\nWe stayed at the B&amp;B Il Tempio di Hera, which is located near the city centre and the archaeological Greek ruins of Selinunte.\nThe days from Saturday to Tuesday could be summarized in this lazy yet melodious French word inspired from Italian: farniente (fare niente means to not do anything). Every day we chilled on the beach all day, reading and swimming. We only left the beach for some delicious pastas, pizza or arancini at lunch time.\n                             \n                               In the evening we exclusively ate the most delicious local fresh fish. We highly recommend two restaurants: Boomerang and Frescomare. Both offer a very extensive 8-course fixed menu that will make you discover the best fish and seafood dishes of Sicily: sardines, whiting, red mullet, octopus, swordfish, mussels and many more. Let's just say we had so much fish that on Tuesday we actually had to go for a steak at restaurant Lu Disiu."},{"Item1":"Day 5 - morning: Scala dei Turchi (Realmonte)","Item2":"Scala dei Turchi (Realmonte)\nOn Wednesday, feeling perfectly relaxed after four days on the beach, we decided it was time to discover the beautiful spots that Southern Sicily has to offer. We took the car and started with Scala dei Turchi, a beautiful rock formation on the cost of Realmonte. Scala dei Urchi is made of marl, which gives it this very bright white texture. Although we were there at 10:30 AM it was already quite busy. We still had a nice time swimming and laying in the sun on the rocks.\n                             \n                               Good to note: if you follow the coast west of Scala dei Urchi, you will see some beautiful sand beaches. It didn't look possible to access these beaches by descending from Scala dei Urchi but there should be a way to go there by following the normal road."},{"Item1":"Day 5 - afternoon: Valle dei Templi (Agrigento)","Item2":"Valle dei Templi (Agrigento)\nAfter Scala dei Urchi we drove to Vallei dei Templi (Valley of Temples) in Agrigento. The entrance costs 10 euros and gives you access to one of the most important archeological site for Greater Greece art and architecture (UNESCO World Heritage site). The Temple of Concordia, perfectly preserved although it was built in the 6th century AD, is especially impressive (see photo).\nA word of advice: if you visit Vallei di Templi during the hottest part of the day, make sure to wear a hat and carry a lot of water as there are only a few areas protected from the sun and the total walk is somewhat long.\n                             \n                               For lunch we had some simple but tasty shrimp pastas at La Posata Di Federico II in the city centre of Agrigento.\nWe then headed back to Marinella di Selinunte, not without stopping at Eraclea Minoa. Another important archeological site of Ancient Greater Greece, Eraclea Minoa is a beautiful village with a one of the best beaches we have seen in Sicily (see photo here)."},{"Item1":"Day 6: San Vito Lo Capo","Item2":"San Vito Lo Capo\nOn Thursday we left Southern Sicily and Marinella di Selinunte for San Vito Lo Capo in the northwestern part of Sicily. San Vito Lo Capo is famous for supposedly having the best beach in Sicily. This is certainly true: the beach of San Vito Lo Capo is just marvellous with the finest white sand you could ever imagine. Unfortunately, because of a rebellious sun the picture I took of San Vito Lo Capo doesn't do much justice to the beauty of its beach and mountain range that surrounds it.\nSan Vito Lo Capo is not Sicily's best-kept secret and, thus, is very crowded: we were there on a week day at the end of September around 10:30 AM and yet it was already difficult to find a quiet place on the beach near the water. Nonetheless, this is a breathtaking spot that should be on any Sicily itinerary!\n                             \n                               We were lucky to visit San Vito Lo Capo while the famous city's annual Couscous fest was taking place so we had some nice chicken couscous for lunch.\nWe then headed to Castellammare Del Golfo where we had booked a very nice residence (Lu Baruni) located between the city centre of Castellammare del Golfo and the village of Scopello. In the evening, as part of our fish rehab, we had burgers with Sicilian wine (nero d'avola) at Cantina Aurelia Wine Bar and a gelato (ice-cream) for dessert at Gelateria Vernaci."},{"Item1":"Day 7: Riserva naturale dello Zingaro","Item2":"Riserva naturale dello Zingaro\nBrace yourselves for the highlight of our trip to Sicily in 1 week: Riserva naturale dello Zingaro. Lo Zingaro Nature Reserve is located exactly between Castellammare del Golfo and San Vito Lo Capo. Therefore, at some point plans were made to build a motorway to join the two cities. Luckily, a strong mobilization prevented the project from happening and instead the first natural reserve of Sicily was created in 1981.\nLo Riserva naturale dello Zingaro is an amazing place with hiking trails for all levels. The coastal way is especially beautiful with many pristine beaches and charming creeks blessed with the clearest blue water. We started hiking around 10:00 AM from the south entrance that is located about 15 minutes by car from Castellammare del Golfo, right after the village of Scopello. The total hike from south to north is 6 km with a very small elevation. It's not a circuit so you have to retrace your steps, which results in a total hike of 12 km. Not bad for a sports parenthesis in this beach holiday!\n                             \n                               It was a lazy hike though with a lot of swimming breaks. We stopped on the way to the north of Zingaro at Calla della Disa (picture) and Cala dell'Uzzo and on the way back at Cala Marinella and Cala Berretta. Cala Tonnarella dell'Uzzo, the nearest beach from the north entrance, also looked amazing with its fine sand but there were too many people so we didn't stop. We finished our hike around 15:30 and had some late lunch in Scopello. If we had more days to spare we would certainly have spent more time in Zingaro and explored the interior trails of the nature reserve, likely more generous in flora and fauna - the humid microclimate of Zingaro is a haven for more than 650 plant species and at least 39 bird species.\nIn the evening we had dinner at L'Isola del Gusto in Castellammare del Golfo."},{"Item1":"Day 8 - morning: Scopello (village)","Item2":"Scopello (village)\nOn Saturday morning we went to Tonnara di Scopello, the marvellous spot where you can observe from close those legendary rocks featured on many Sicily postcards (see main trip photo).

Note that there's a 3.50 euros-entrance fee and that the nearest authorized parking lot costs 1 euro per hour."},{"Item1":"Day 8 - afternoon: Castellamare del Golfo","Item2":"Castellamare del Golfo\nIn the afternoon we headed to the beach of Castellammare del Golfo located 5 minutes away by car from the town's centre. There we had some nice pastas for lunch at Lido Pirata. We then spent some time perfecting our tan on the beach and swimming. The beach of Castellammare del Golfo is quite huge and has sand unlike most of the beaches in the area.\nWe then visited the centre of Castellammare del Golfo. The castle, the port and the historic centre are especially interesting. In the evening, we were lucky to find a nice place in Scopello for dinner - Bar Nettuno - where we had the most exquisite pastas of our Sicily trip (make sure to ask for them to the waiter as they are not on the menu).\n                             \n                               Finally, the next day we got up early and flew back home from Palermo, feeling relaxed but, most of all, highly impressed by Sicily and the breathtaking beauty of its historical sites and natural spots."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/melville-moby-dick-places-map-itinerary/","Title":"Moby-Dick places: itinerary of a fatalistic journey on the oceans","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["East Asia","Japan","Taiwan","Southeast Asia","Indonesia","Philippines","Massachusetts","New York","New York City","South Africa","United States"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Books","Culture","Legendary","Sea"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Manhattan Island, New York","Item2":"There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf.

Most Mont Saint-Michel crossing tours start from the town of Genêts at Bec d'andaine. The total hike is 6 km (3.7 mi) with a pit stop about half way at the small island of Tombelaine. Once at Mont Saint-Michel you can visit the island for a few hours and then either come back by bus or cross again the bay by walking.\nUnfortunately, tour guides only offer group tours to cross the Mont Saint-Michel bay on foot from April to October. Therefore, we had to settle for a hike around Mont-Saint Michel for this Christmas winter escape. Nonetheless, it was a wonderful experience that we warmly recommend to anyone visiting Normandy during this time.\n                             \n                               We started our walk from the west side of Mont Saint-Michel where we could see the island of Tombelaine far away in the fog.\nOn the west side of Mont Saint-Michel is the Saint-Aubert Chapel.

Although there's no real risk of getting stuck until chest level, sea muds ('tangue') around Mont Saint-Michel can be dangerous if you get stuck alone when the tide rises. Note that there are real and dangerous quicksands if you go further in the Mont Saint-Michel Bay. Make sure to be with a guide at all time!\nThe Mont Saint-Michel Bay has a unique ecosystem with hundreds of different plan species growing at different places depending on how much they love water. The little patches of grass on the photo below are Salicornia, a tasty sea plant that strives in salty ground and can stand to be fully immersed under sea at high tide. Beware: this plant is protected and it's allowed to pick up only two handfuls per person per day.\n                             \n                               On the east side of Mont Saint-Michel you can admire the grandiose gothic choir of the Abbey. At this moment Mont Saint-Michel appeared more beautiful than ever. I had been countless times at the Mont but the grey athmosphere and the impression of infinity from the wide space left uncovered by the ocean at low tide made this experience unique. And surreal: somehow it felt like our group of walkers were intruding on the quiet private area of the sea, like if it had gone somewhere for a shortwhile and we were lurking around, waiting anxiously for its ineluctable return."},{"Item1":"Tombelaine, polders and sunset","Item2":"After a while the sky opened up and the sun shined through, showing Mont Saint-Michel and the Bay under delicate wintry colors.\nAbout half way to the coast of Normandy, northeast of Mont Saint-Michel, is the small island of Tombelaine. It's now uninhabited but some ruins remain. It's a de facto nature reserve for birds – each year Tombelaine is a haven for about 35,000 sea gulls. It takes about 40 minutes to reach Tombelaine from Mont Saint-Michel but we didn't go as it wasn't part of the tour. We will most definitely come back again in spring or summer to fully cross the bay on foot and visit Tombelaine at the same time!\nWe could also witness the polders far away in the beautiful Mont Saint-Michel Bay at low tide before sunset.\n                             \n                               Visiting Mont Saint-Michel nowadays is to witness a historical change: since 2005, a project aiming to restore the maritime character of Mont Saint-Michel has started. In other words, the goal is to make Mont Saint-Michel a true island again, connected to the land only by a thin bridge.\nThis should prevent the silting of the Mont caused by human activities like the building of dams. When we were there (December 2014), the Pré-Salé (salted meadows where sheep herbs are kept) was still quite close to Mont Saint-Michel but in the coming years it should significantly recede as the sea rightfully takes back its right on Mont Saint-Michel."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/24-hours-rotterdam-itinerary-by-ak/","Title":"24 hours in Rotterdam (itinerary) – by A&#038;K","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["Europe","Western Europe","Netherlands"],"Duration":"1 day","Themes":["Culture","Urban"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Rotterdam Centraal Station to Witte de Withstraat (city center)","Item2":"We started the itinerary of our 24 hours in Rotterdam by a stroll through the city center after arriving in Rotterdam Centraal (railway station).

The ticket is $30 for a 1.5-hour cruise (half-circle itinerary) but you can get a discount if you have the New York City pass.\nIt was already late in the day but there was a very thick fog and it was raining - not exactly the ideal conditions for a sightseeing boat ride! It was especially frustrating since the weather was so beautiful the days before. It actually got worse once we were on the Hudson River, to the extent that everyone was worried we wouldn't get to see the Statue of Liberty at all. \n                             \n                               The weather slightly improved and allowed to see the outline of the Statue but it was not great. Nonetheless, it was an interesting experience with the fog and rain as well as the still water creating a surreal atmosphere.\nEllis Island, gateway to millions of immigrants aspiring to the American Dream, was also impressive, although equally trapped in a mist. That one is definitely on my list of attractions to visit for next time I'm in New York!\nI also caught a glimpse of the World Trade Center but it was quite foggy as well."},{"Item1":"Day 1 - afternoon & evening: High Line, lunch at Katz Deli, East & West Villages, dinner at Cannibal","Item2":"After the ferry cruise I headed to the High Line just nearby on West 34th Street. The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33 km) linear park built on an elevated section of a disused railroad line. The High Line is a breath of fresh air at the center of restless West Side Manhattan. If the Big Apple is starting to wear you down after a couple of days, I warmly recommend you to take a walk on the High Line to recharge your batteries. The quiet High Line goes through some very beautiful streets in Chelsea, providing a unique perspective of New York.\nI got off the High Line at its terminus on Gansevoort Street. It was already late in the afternoon and I was hungry so I took a taxi to Katz's Deli in the East Village on East Houston Street where I had a delicious and huge beef brisket sandwich. I always wanted to visit this place ever since I saw it in the video of Diggin' in the Crates by Mister Modo &amp; Ugly Mc Beer and I was certainly not dissapointed although it was a bit pricy ($18!).\n                             \n                               After that I strolled through the East Village and visited the A1 record shop specializing in out-of-print vinyls (also featured in the Diggin' in the Crates clip!). The day took a dark turn though when two buildings exploded just a few blocks away from the record shop. There was a huge fire and literally dozens of fire trucks, ambulances and police cars. I didn't realize how serious the accident was then but later I learned that sadly two people died in the explosion with many others severely injured.\nIn the evening, I had a nice dinner at Cannibal, a restaurant on 29th Street (not far from Martha Washington Hotel) specializing in local meat and craft beers from all over the United States. I had delicious hot dogs and bacon with, of course, a few beers (I highly recommend the Flower Power IPA)."},{"Item1":"Day 2 - morning: Financial District and Brooklyn Bridge","Item2":"On day 2 of this New York 3-day itinerary I had breakfast at the Gregorys Coffee on Park Avenue and then took a subway to New York's Financial District to see the World Trade Center, Ground Zero and Wall Street.\nFrom all the TV series I had watched taking place in New York's Financial District like Suits I expected quite a busy area with fast-paced businessmen walking in all directions. Instead I was surprised to see how calm the streets were but I guess the early bird catches the worm after all and being outside at 11:00 is only good for gappers.\n                             \n                               I then enjoyed the view of Brooklyn from South Street Seaport before hopping on the massive and legendary Brooklyn Bridge connecting the south of Manhattan to Brooklyn.\nAlthough it's quite busy, the walk on the Brooklyn Bridge is a unique experience with stunning views of the Financial District, Brooklyn and the Manhattan Bridge. I was quite inspired by all the messenger bikes racing at high speed on the bridge so next time I will definitely rent a bike and it will be my turn to scare tourists walking on the wrong side of the path."},{"Item1":"Day 2 - afternoon: Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg (and Aikido!)","Item2":"In the afternoon I walked through the streets of Brooklyn Heights, pleased to finally see those classical buildings as seen in gangster movies like Goodfellas, described in Paul Auster's novels and rapped over in hip-hop songs. My imagination and wandering nature helped to spice up a bit the successsion of quiet residential blocks one after another with not many striking landmarks but overall it was not the most exciting walk. Court Street was a bit more animated but it still seemed like a world away from the busy streets of Manhattan besieged by skyscrapers.\nThe view of Manhattan from the bank of the East River right after the Brooklyn Bridge is not especially great so I was advised to reach Red Hook for the best view. I walked in that direction but at some point the streets just turned desert and derelict. It looked like it was still a long way to Red Hook so I decided to turn back and take a subway to Williamsburg in the north of Brooklyn.\n                             \n                               These wanderings were merely an introduction to Brooklyn. Next time, I will make sure to note a few places down in advance and visit of Brooklyn at night, including a few hip-hop places, to experience the real vibe of this mythical borough of New York.\nIn the evening I visited the Shin Budo Kai aikido dojo on 8th Avenue. The dojo is headed by Shizuo Imaizumi, direct student of aikido founder O Sensei Morihei Ueshiba, and offers lessons almost every day of the week. It was a great opportunity to train with Sensei Imaizumi and his students for 2 solid hours. I was so exhausted and hungry after training that I dragged myself to a Chipotle for a massive burrito."},{"Item1":"Day 3 - morning: Rockefeller Center (Top of the Rock), Central Park","Item2":"For my last full day in New York I got up early to be at the observation deck of the Rockefeller Center (Top of the Rock) at 9:00 AM and enjoy a view of the city from the 71st story of the building. I chose the Rockefeller Center over the Empire State Building to, ironically, have a view over the Empire State and also because I suspected the waiting time would be shorter at the Rockefeller Center. I pre-booked my ticket the day before and I didn't have to wait at all. The overall experience was smooth and highly impressive with a breathtaking view of the whole city. The sight of Central Park is especially amazing; from so high the park really stands out as a beautiful green forest daunting the concrete jungle around.\nI then took a subway to the Upper-East Side for a nice breakfast at Joe Coffee on Lexington Avenue before heading to Central Park for a wonderful walk. I found the Great Lawn and the Reservoir to be especially impressive but I also quite enjoyed the quiet forest paths all around. This is when I really thought to myself: I could live here. No matter how overwhelming New York would feel at times, I could always find some peace in these woods. What would Shakespeare think? Well, regardless, I'm sure the Bard would be pleased by the lovely garden built in his memory in 1916.\n                             \n                               For lunch I escaped Central Park on the West Side and took a subway to Tom's Restaurant on Broadway. If you are a Seinfeld fan you probably know this place as Monk's Café the fictional diner where Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer meet to discuss the most random things. The place was quite packed so I didn't stay for lunch. I knew this wasn't a required Seinfeld tribute since the interior scenes at Monk's Café were filmed in a studio.\nStarting to feel really hungry after all this walking in Central Park, I had a delicious burger with a vanilla shake at Shake Shack. This was my second fast food joint in New York after Chipotle and I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food: most of the ingredients were organic and really fresh in both places."},{"Item1":"Day 3 - afternoon/evening: Metropolitan Museum of Art","Item2":"In the afternoon I visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art or, as New Yorkers simply call it, The Met. The museum is huge and encompasses an incredible variety of art from many world regions and eras.\n                             \n                               If you have been to the Louvre in Paris, expect a similar strenuous experience if you plan to visit the entire museum. I was already very tired from all the walking accomplished so far so I focused on Egyptian Art, European Paintings and Modern and Contemporay Art.\nNo doubt I will still have a lot to see next time I visit the Met!"}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/a-tale-of-two-cities-dickens-map-places/","Title":"A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: a map of all the places in France and England","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["Europe","Northern Europe","United Kingdom","England","Western Europe","France","Île-de-France","Paris","Beauvais","London"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Books","History","Legendary"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Dover road, Shooter’s Hill, England","Item2":"The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.\n\n                             \n                               &nbsp;"},{"Item1":"Ship Hotel (demolished), Dover, England","Item2":"When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was.

On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.\n                             \n                               One of the most iconic areas London, Soho is one of the happy A Tales of Two Cities places: the nest of Doctor Manette and his daughter Lucie is located nearby.

Not the best idea ever as most of the restaurants/pubs weren't open at that time (around 9am). We explored the awakening market and had great coffee and pastries at the cafe at the center of the market. Our caffeine level back at a satisfactory level, we took the subway and came back to the city center, in Piccadilly Circus, to sip a few beers before getting the keys to our apartment. The wait ended up being a little longer than expected but, checking in in our flat, we all agreed this was worth it!

We got up early and grabbed some delicious croissants on the way before crossing the Rhône and the Saône. The weather was perfect, sunny but not too warm with a delicious morning breeze to wake us up gently. We were quite surprised to see how empty the city was though. There is a nice market on the banks of the Rhône (Quai Victor Augagneur) but even there it was rather quiet. What we didn't know is that Lyon truly awakens later in the day and becomes a vibrant city in the evening with everyone out in cafes and restaurants enjoying the douce Joie de vivre of Southern France.\nIn Vieux Lyon we first saw the imposing Palais de justice historique de Lyon and visited the Cathédrale Saint-Jean-Baptiste. We then wandered around the narrow streets of Quartier Saint-Jean (Saint-Jean quarter) with their medieval feel and architecture.\n                             \n                               Something not to miss in the Old Town are the famous Traboules, which are passageways through buildings to cross from one street to another. They were mainly used by merchants to transport their goods but also by the French Resistance to escape Nazi soldiers during World War II.\nTraboules sometimes have a very unique style and architecture that creates a special athmosphere when you visit them. In the Vieux Lyon, most of them are actually located in private buildings so you need to ring at the door to enter. This gives a very exciting and mysterious, almost clandestine, feel to the whole experience! You can visit this page for the complete list of Traboules in Vieux Lyon.\nFor lunch we had some delicious quenelles de brochet (pike) and andouillette in a Bouchon Lyonnais, a type of traditional restaurant in Lyon celebrating convivial atmosphere and simple yet very tasty food. We went to Comptoir du Boeuf and really recommend it for the great quality and service! It's advised to reserve in advance as the terrasse quickly gets full after 13:00."},{"Item1":"Day 1: afternoon and dinner","Item2":"Fourvière ('the hill that prays'): Ancient Theatre and Cathedral\nIn the afternoon, feeling heavy after lunch, we decided to remedy the situation by climbing the hill of Fourvière, nicknamed the Mystical Hill by Jules Michelet who wanted to emphasize the opposition between Fourvière 'the hill that prays' and la Croix-Rousse 'the hill that works'.\nWe visited the Théâtre antique de Lyon, the oldest theatre in France built by Augustus in 15 BC. Surprisingly the site has been well preserved through the ages and, although it's not as massive as what you would expect from a theatre that was welcoming more than ten thousands persons in 120, it's still rather impressive. The access to the ancient site is free but you have to pay to visit the Gallo-Roman Museum.\nAfter that we went to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, located a bit further uphill after the Ancient Theatre. With its Romanesque and Byzantine grand architecture, the basilica is quite stunning and rises above Lyon the same way the Sacré-Cœur dominates Paris.\n                             \n                               We then climbed down back to the Vieux Lyon by the Montée des Chazeaux and headed to Lyon's shopping center around Place Bellecour and rue de la République.\nIn the evening we had dinner at the Terrasses de Lyon (Villa Florentine). The restaurant is located in Fourvière so we had to take the Montée des Chazeaux again but the way up this time, which was breathtaking, literally, with its 228 steps.\nLes Terrasses de Lyon is a one-star Michelin restaurant. We normally don't eat that fancy but being in Lyon, France's food capital, and celebrating a birthday, we made an exception. The dinner was delicious although I always find it difficult to get your money's worth when you pay so much for a meal! The highlight of the menu? Definitely, the Pigeon royal d’Anjou. The restaurant also offers a beautiful view of the city and, allegedly, the Mont-Blanc when the sky is clear."},{"Item1":"Day 2 - morning & lunch","Item2":"Parc de la Tête d'Or, Croix-Rousse\nOn the second day of this weekend in Lyon we repeated our now almost ritual of picking up croissants on the way and then headed to the Parc de la Tête d'Or, Lyon's largest park, to enjoy them on the grass in the sun. We walked around the lake of the park and visited the free zoo. Although Lyon is certainly not the most oppressingly urban city with its cute streets and Rhône and the Saône passing through its heart, the Parc de la Tête d'Or is still a nice nature getaway within its walls.\nWe then took the Pont Winston Churchill to reach Lyon's Croix-Rousse, nicknamed 'the hill that works' by Jules Michelet (see above) and, indeed, the quarter was an important landmark of the silk industry in Europe. Because of this past, la Croix-Rousse features many Traboules just like in Vieux Lyon.\n                             \n                               The most famous Traboule is located at the junction of Colbert Square and rue Diderot. From there you can descend almost the whole quarter of Croix-Rousse by following this sign in each subsequent street.\nAfter this whole Traboule-treasure hunt, we took some rest and enjoyed a delicious cup of coffee at Café Mokxa - La Boîte à Café.\nWe had lunch in Burgundy Lounge, a Bourgogne wine themed restaurant that provides a very exciting culinary experience: you pick your Burgundy wine and the chef arranges a surprise menu to match your selection. The wine was amazing, the food very decent and the ensemble reasonably priced so we would definitely recommend it! The only downside is that Burgundy Lounge doesn't have a terrasse so you cannot enjoy the sun at lunch."},{"Item1":"Day 2 - afternoon","Item2":"Hôtel de Ville, Opéra\nAfter lunch we continued exploring the 1st arrondissement for the last stroll of this weekend in Lyon. We walked past the Hôtel de Ville de Lyon, the relatively new Opera Nouvel built between 1985 and 1993, and the Paroisse Catholique Saint Nizier.\nWe also wanted to visit the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon (Fine Arts Museum) but we were a bit short on time and also thought it would be a waste of such beautiful sunny afternoon to spend it inside.\n                             \n                               We then slowly walked to Gare de la Part-Dieu to catch the Rhonexpress back to the airport. The ride takes 30 minutes and costs 25.70 euros.\nThis 2-day weekend in Lyon was really lovely and gave us a good feel of the city and its different areas. Next time we come back we'll try to stay longer and use Lyon as a base to explore the surrounding nature that is supposed to be quite beautiful as well."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/jurassic-park-filming-locations-hawaii/","Title":"Jurassic Park filming locations in Hawaii","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["Central America","Costa Rica","North America","United States","California","Mojave Desert","Red Rock Canyon State Park","Hawaii","Kaua&#039;i","Kalaheo","Hanapepe Valley","Kapa&#039;a","Hoopii Falls","Kuhio Highway","Limahuli Garden and Preserve","Na Pali Coast State Park","Valley House","Koloa","Allerton Garden","Mount Waialeale","Olokele Canyon","Puu Ka Ele Reservoir","Montana","Makoshika State Park (badlands)","Dominican Republic","Kaneohe","Kualoa Ranch"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Horror","Legendary","Movies"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Tyrannosaurus rex container scene","Item2":"Limahuli Garden, 5-8291 Kuhio Highway, Hanalei, Kauai, Hawaii\nThe terrifying prologue scene where a mysterious Tyrannosaurus rex is being released into Jurassic Park, not without snapping up an employee in the process, was filmed in Limahuli Garden in Hanalei on Kauai island.\nThe garden is part of the National Tropical Botanical Garden and can be visited.\n                             \n                               John Hammond: All major theme parks have delays.

Landing at 11PM in Entebbe, where the principal international airport of Uganda is located around 40km away from Kampala, I first handled the immigration formalities for my VISA. It costs $ 50 and you must have this amount ready in US Dollars - banknotes and/or coins. Note that your passport needs to be valid more than 6 months after the end of your trip. Also, it is possible that officials ask for an international health certificate showing you've had a yellow fever shot (see the note on health at the bottom of this page).\nGoing from Entebbe to Kampala, the easiest solution is to take a special hire (= taxi, see note on transportation at the bottom of this page) - approx. 1hr30mins, UGX 80,000 / € 23,5). I had my own arrangements in Kampala, but I know a lot of people like to stay at the Red Chilli Hideaway that provides great services for a moderate price. Also, the swimming pool is great!\nExploring Kampala\nI woke up early for my first full day in Kampala and went to the newly opened Village Mall (near Spring Road) to get breakfast. The Brood bakery had been warmly recommended to me (located just at the entrance of the mall) and I must say I wasn't disappointed. Great coffee, delicious pastries and warm bread are all served by a friendly staff.\n                             \n                               After having exchanged my Euros against Ugandan Shillings in the mall, I went to the Railway Station to visit the Kampala Contemporary Art Festival (Oct. 2014). This festival presents the work of artists from the East Africa region: you find great pieces of art by Ethiopian, Congolese and Ugandan artists. Entrance is free &amp; guiding services are excellent. You can find paintings, photographs, short movies and more conceptual works.\nMy next step was to visit the Gaddafi National Mosque. I took a boda-boda (small moto taxi) to get there (approx. UGX 3000 / € 1). The mosque entrance fee is UGX 10,000 / € 3. After removing our shoes we entered the imposing building and had a pleasant visit, led by a knowledgeable &amp; very nice guide. He sang and prayed to show us the sound movements and echoes. We then went up at the top of the minaret to enjoy an impressive 360-degree view of Kampala.\nI ended up my day visiting the Makerere University campus. Founded in 1922, the university enjoys a first-class reputation in East Africa. The university is located on the Nakasero hill and the campus is really massive. Walking there is really pleasant, especially to look at the old buildings (20th century British architecture) and some promising pieces of art in the Makerere Art Gallery."},{"Item1":"Day 3: From Kampala to Kabale and Lake Bunyonyi - Itambira Island, Uganda","Item2":"Going to Lake Bunyonyi\n\nMy first destination outside Kampala was Lake Bunyonyi (literally the \"Place of many little birds\") in the south of the country, which boasts a very good reputation among nature lovers. I took a bus (Bismarkan Coaches) at 8:30AM from the Kampala bus station to Kabale. The cost is around UGX 30000 / € 9 for this 7 to 8-hour journey. I reached Kabale at 4pm and then took a shared taxi to Rutinda, which is located 10 km away from Kabale on the shores of Lake Bunyonyi. The next step was .. paddling! Indeed to reach the Itambira island where my hostel, Byoona Amagara, was located, I took a canoe from Rutinda to the island. The canoe journey takes around 45 minutes and there is no cost if you use Byoona Amagara canoes (arranged by the hostel). The landscapes are truly amazing, especially at this time of the day when the colors are really nice. The end of the journey was a bit more complicated as a thunderstorm started not so far away, we even had to stop on a tiny island as the wind and the waves became too strong. We finally made it safely (but drenched!) to the Byoona Amagara's pier.\n                             \n                               Reaching the backpacking paradise\nThe Byoona Amagara hostel is a true backpacking paradise! The main reception and dining area boasts a ridiculously splendid view over the lake and other islands. If you want to make the most of the experience, you can stay in geodomes. Those are 1, 2 or 3-people domes with a large terrace and without front wall so you can enjoy the view. The roof covers well the habitation and the mosquito net is included. This makes the perfect sleeping location for couples, nature and bird-lovers, as well as anyone willing to wake up in front of a magnificent landscape (expect to pay around UGX 80,000 / € 24 per night for two people, a bit less if you're alone). You can also stay in dorms or set up your tent for a few euros. The food &amp; drinks menu is quite comprehensive and the overall quality is really good. Try to order at least 45 minutes in advance as service can be long especially in high season. The swimming pear is nicely arranged and sun bathing chairs are available. Access to the water is easy &amp; safe, as is swimming (no bilharzia, no crocodile, only fresh water!)."},{"Item1":"Day 4: Lake Bunyonyi - Itambira Island","Item2":"Waking up in paradise\nWaking up on Itambira island feels a bit like paradise. Birds singing and vivid sun light are both very helpful to get you out of your dreams! I ordered the Itambiran crepes for breakfast (composed of local fruits and cinnamon), while enjoying the marvellous view over the lake.\nSwimming in the Lake Bunyonyi (crocodile free &amp; bilharzia free) is very pleasant and very safe as said previously, but be careful not to overthink your swimming skills as distance between islands can be significant and altitude lowers your stamina.\n                             \n                               Hiking around Lake Bunyonyi\nI then took a tour of the Itambira island (do not require specific hiking skills) that takes around 1 hour or a bit more, if you accept the (not insistent) requests from locals to make you visit craft workshops or from fishermen willing to show you their nets and techniques (also, fish degustation can be safely accepted). You can take outstanding pictures form the top of the island, which culminates at around 1,950 m. Another thunderstorm came shortly after I made it back to the hostel. This was quite impressive and produced a dramatic sky with darkish colors, but also spots of light on the nearby hills. I used this time to start reading the book \"True at First Light\" from Ernest Hemingway, which is available in the (free) library of the hostel. Oh, and yes, they also have a mini cinema set up... The backpacker paradise as I said :)\nI enjoyed a great crayfish dish for diner (UGX 12,500 / € 4) and spent my second night in Byoona Amagara hostel."},{"Item1":"Day 5: Journey from Kabale to Kisoro","Item2":"Going back to Kabale\nLeaving Itambira island at 7:30AM, I used once again the canoe service of the hotel, with a backpacker from Austria, to go back to Rutinda and then Kabale. The canoe journey was really nice as the lake was full of boats coming from all the islands and going to the market in Rutinda. Market is on Monday and Thursday, and it's really interesting to see: lots of colors, smells, discussions .. and bargaining. Our paths diverged at this point and I took a boda-boda to go from Rutinda to Kabale. The road is not paved so you can expect a bumpy journey but the scenery is awesome.\nWhen arriving in Kabale I went to the Amagara Cafe, which is supposed to offer the best value for small-medium budget. The meal was good but don't expect the same quality as its sister hostel, Byoona Amagara hostel on the Itambira island. Going to Kisoro was my goal of the day, I thus went to the Bismarkan Coaches bus company office and bought a ticket (approx. UGX 10,000 / € 3). Bus is coming from Kampala and stops in Kabale between 1 and 3PM, depending on road conditions &amp; traffic. Expect then a 2-hour journey to reach Kisoro. Do seat near the window as the landscapes are stunning! You'll see the Echuya Forest (bamboo and montane forest) and parts of the Virunga Mountains (a chain of isolated, freestanding volcanoes).\n                             \n                               Arriving in Kisoro\nI stayed at the Golden Monkey Hotel, a public guest house in Kisoro, which offers decent rooms and dorms as well as good food and a reliable Internet connection. Staff is very friendly and prices are competitive! Expect a few electricity/Internet interruptions, especially during the rainy season.\nI had a late but good lunch at the Coffee Pot Café and that's also where I went for diner, as their Chili con carne had been warmly recommended to me. I ended the day having drinks at the Travellers Rest, which has a really nice bar with a fireplace and great atmosphere. Definitely a must-do in Kisoro! Expect to pay UGX 5,000 for a glass of wine or a beer, around UGX 24,000 for a diner."},{"Item1":"Day 6: Hiking from Kisoro to Lake Mutanda, Uganda","Item2":"Hiking around Kisoro\n\nKisoro is famous for being close to the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, which is the smallest one in Uganda but certainly not the least interesting! The park is located in the Virunga Mountains, near Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A pleasant city, Kisoro offers plenty of opportunities for nature lovers. Hiking was my choice but you can also go for Gorilla or Monkey tracking, mountain biking, Birdwatching, canoe or fishing... For my 1st day around, I went hiking in the morning in the small hills around town. This resulted in a very pleasant walk with nice city and nature views, especially on the three (inactive) volcanoes of the park: Mount Muhabura (4,127 m), Mount Gahinga (3,474 m) and Mount Sabyinyo (3,699 m). The lights are amazing in the morning and it is definitely recommended to start your day early (8AM maximum!). If you want to catch the sunrise that illuminates the top of the volcanoes, be out at 6 or 6:15AM. Walking around town will let you explore the plantations on the hills and meet with the friendly people of the region.\n                             \n                               Hiking from Kisoro to Lake Mutanda\nMy plan was to hike from Kisoro to Lake Mutanda in the afternoon. Lake Mutanda is located beyond the hills at the north of the city (around 5 Km away). Leaving from the Golden Monkey Hotel, it takes around 1 hour and 30 mins to climb up the hills and then reach the south part of the lake. People from the villages/houses on the path will offer to guide you there and give explanations (a tip of UGX 6,000 / 8,000 seems to be right). The Mutanda Eco Community Centre that lies on the south shore of the lake offers accommodations, food and several activities. That's where I had a (good) lunch. The location is stunning and the lake beautiful (though a bit less impressive than lake Bunyonyi). The activities offered range from birding, nature walks, canoeing or trekking, to Python tracking (in a cave not far away) - without forgetting the snake island for the most adventurous amongst us! I came back to Kisoro using a boda-boda, which was not easy to find! The owner of the center ended up calling one for me, as my efforts were in vain... Note that children in the neighbouring villages can be quite insistent asking for money. While this is perfectly appropriate to give a tip when someone is helping, giving money without any reason is not advised. Staying polite and smiling seem to be the best behavior - Do avoid looking lost (even if you are)!"},{"Item1":"Day 7: Climbing up Mount Sabyinyo - Mgahinga Gorilla National Park","Item2":"The actual trekking - Mount Sabyinyo\nThe big day! Mount Sabyinyo, here we go :) As you can expect from a 3,669 m high mountain, climbing up to the top is no easy task! Add to that rapidly changing weather (from warm to cold and humid conditions), and you get an interesting cocktail.\nThe hike starts with a pleasant approach in the forest (bamboos), with a few clear areas that offer great views over the mountains. The route takes you through all kinds of vegetation types and you soon start climbing quite hard, while the path gets narrower. You have to beat 3 peaks to reach the summit. The first one rises 3,423 m above sea level, the second one 3,537 m and the third one 3,669 m! As tough as the ascent can be (vertical ladders, steep paths, aerial passages...), standing up at the top greatly compensates it. You'll stare at the never-ending hilly landscape of Rwanda, the Congolese rainforests (where several groups of mountain gorillas are living) and the Kisoro's region with Lake Mutanda in Uganda...\nTaking return into consideration, cumulative elevation gain must be close to 1,750 m for this hike, which starts to represent an interesting challenge! Guides usually indicate that 8 to 10 hours are needed round trip. It took me 8 hours, but I was on my own and I guess that being in a group implies a slower pace. I started to hike at 7AM, right after the park's opening and the official briefing of my guide. The lights and natural colors were truly wonderful early in the morning. I had rain on the way back, when going down, which complicated things as ladders became slippery!\n                             \n                               What you should know before signing for this trek!\nBooking for this hike will include the National Park's entrance fee, one guide and one (armed) ranger to protect you against wild animals (mostly water buffalos). Cost was $ 60 in October 2014. I gathered information for my hike at the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park office in Kisoro, where employees are knowledgeable and very helpful. The office is located very close to the Coffee Pot Café, not far from the Golden Monkey Hotel. The three volcanoes of the park can be climbed: Muhabura (4,127 m), Gahinga (3,474 m) and Sabyinyo (3,699 m). I chose to climb Sabyinyo mainly for the satisfaction of standing in 3 countries simultaneously when reaching the top: Uganda, Rwanda and Congo! Also several friends had advised me to hike the old man's teeth, as locals call the mountain.\nAfter adding the transportation cost ($ 50 for a taxi that brings you at the park entrance, wait for you and then bring you back in Kisoro - $ 20 for a boda-boda) and some shopping items (solar cream, 2 liters of water, ...), expect a total of around $ 125 for this activity. Good hiking boots, gloves and a warm (but light) hiking jacket are all recommended. This will still be much cheaper than the $ 600 permit (not including park fees and transportations) to go gorilla tracking!\nIf you are subject to vertigo, think twice as some aerial passages and vertical ladders must be defeated..."},{"Item1":"Days 8-9: Journey from Kisoro back to Kampala","Item2":"I caught the very first Bismarkan bus scheduled at 5AM (actually left at 5:45AM) to go back to Kampala. I surprisingly paid less for this route (UGX 22,500 / € 7) compared to the Kampala-Kabale journey (UGX 30,000 / € 9). Expect a 8 to 10 hours drive, partly due to the huge traffic jams when approaching Kampala. I even got off the coach at some point in Kampala, as we were totally stuck. I managed to take a boda-boda to get back faster to the place I was staying at.\n                             \n                               The next day I went to the Red Chilli Hideaway to enjoy the swimming pool and the nice view over the city's suburb. This hotel is well-known by the backpackers as it offers a nice place to stay in Kampala with good facilities and at a moderate price. Furthermore, great pieces of advice can be taken from the owners. You'll be able to book for many activities in Uganda directly from there: gorilla tracking, rafting on the Nile, mountain climbing, Safari game drive..."},{"Item1":"Day 10: Resting on the banks of Lake Albert (Lake Albert Safari Lodge)","Item2":"Next on our list was the legendary Lake Albert! Africa's seventh-largest lake, Lake Albert is located between Congo and Uganda. It took us around 7 hours to drive from Kampala to the Lake Albert Safari Lodge, where we had booked a camping space for 2 tents. This solution is interesting as it is price competitive and you still benefit from all the lodge facilities .. and the chance to sleep outside on the beautiful shore of Lake Albert, in the savannah. While a bit isolated, the lodge's surroundings are truly sensational: it lies at the top of a steep cliff with a first-class view on Lake Albert and Congo on the other side. You'll be able to see fishermen coming back from a long working day on the lake, hear wild animals roaming...\n                             \n                               The sunset is a pure miracle with color variations you just can not imagine before you see them. At night, I recommend to seat around the campfire and watch the natural fireworks above the lake: lightings everywhere! The food at the lodge is really good and the service is excellent."},{"Item1":"Day 11: Heading towards Murchison Falls National Park","Item2":"Leaving Lake Albert\nWe left Lake Albert Safari Lodge in the end of the morning heading to the Murchison Falls National Park, where we had a reservation at the Nile Safari Lodge. Coming from Lake Albert, we drove only on dirt roads that had been drenched by abundant rainfalls. It took us longer than expected (7 hours instead of 5 estimated) and we almost got stuck in the mud at some point. Do not expect precise maps and indications on the road, rely solely on a good GPS and a knowledgeable/experienced driver!\n                             \n                               Arriving in the Nile Safari Lodge\nThe Nile Safari Lodge is an upper-class lodge with great facilities (cottages, gardens, swimming pool, lunch &amp; diner areas, ...) and a nice restaurant. The location is really outstanding, as is the view on the Nile. It is not located in the Murchison Falls National Park, but close to the entrance. Similarly to the day before, we set up our tent in the dedicated space provided by the Lodge and protected by a guard (against animals such as water Buffalos). In terms of cost, expect to pay between $ 30 to $ 80 a night if you sleep in your tent (including breakfast &amp; diner &amp; access to all facilities) instead of $ 250 to $ 500 if you go for cottages."},{"Item1":"Day 12: Hiking around Murchison Falls, Uganda (Murchison River Lodge)","Item2":"Relaxing at Murchison River Lodge\nThe next day we moved to the Murchison River Lodge, which is located 15 minutes away from the Nile Safari Lodge. Though a little bit less luxurious, the Murchison River Lodge is far more welcoming in my humble opinion. Boasting an even more impressive view over the Nile and the Park, the lodge offers modern, top-notch facilities and a great camping ground. The swimming pool is awesome, but be careful with the monkeys trying to steal shiny things! We spent a very relaxing morning taking advantage of the pool, as well as the good food &amp; drink offering.\n                             \n                               Exploring Murchison Falls\nIn the afternoon, we took the car and went to the legendary Murchison Falls! Entering the park (park fees: $ 60 pp for a 24-hr access) we drove to the site that oversees the falls. It is massive... Just imagine a river as big as the Nile being trapped in a 8-meter wide passage! The noise and the water particles expelled from the river are truly impressive. A trail will take you to a viewing point above the falls and you'll then be able to hike down near the banks of the Nile, very close to the water, and see the falls from the bottom (20-min hike). The landscapes are terrific with those huge waterfalls and the park/forest around; definitely a must-do!\nIn the evening we enjoyed quality food at the lodge with a live band singing Ugandan songs around the campfire."},{"Item1":"Day 13: Game drive / Safari in Murchison Falls National Park","Item2":"Leaving Murchison River Lodge (outstanding lodge!) early in the morning (breakfast 5:30am, departure 6am) we drove towards the park's entrance to begin an exciting game drive / safari session. The Murchison Falls National Park opens its doors at 7AM and you have to cross the Nile to really enter the savannah.\nWe first saw a hippo family bathing near the banks of the Nile where we crossed. Those animals are so impressive! Weighting around 1,500 kg (adults), they are the third-largest type of land mammal and ranks among the most dangerous animals in Africa. We hired a park ranger / guide at the park office, after crossing the Nile, and we slowly started to drive in the savannah. We started to see antelopes with the sun rising up higher and illuminating the splendid savannah landscapes. First we saw the beautiful Ugandan kob, then the Hartebeest and finally the small but graceful Oribi.\n                             \n                               Going further we were very lucky to see Rothschild's giraffes (or Ugandan Giraffes), which is one of the most endangered subspecies. We observed a group of 20 or 25 giraffes eating in the savannah. Our guide, Simon, was very experienced and able to explain with a great deal of details animals' characteristics and behaviors, which made the game drive even more interesting! We also saw many warthogs, herd of buffalos, monkeys, birds of all colors and sizes (450 species recorded in the park, including the Shoebill and the Grey crowned crane - Uganda's national bird)...\nIn the end we just missed the king of the jungle: the lion! They have a reputation to be particularly hard to spot and only (very) early-risers with lots of luck usually see them. The savannah scenery is really something to see once in a lifetime, especially for the wildlife but also for the outstanding color variations that make landscapes truly magical."},{"Item1":"Day 14: Journey from Murchison Falls National Park back to Kampala","Item2":"We enjoyed our last breakfast &amp; morning at the Murchison River Lodge with awesome weather conditions. The Nile was particularly beautiful with superb sky reflections. Taking pictures and relaxing were our two main activities.\n                             \n                               We left the lodge at around 10am and drove back to Kampala. Taking into account the huge traffic jams when getting closer to the city, the road trip took us approximately 7 hours."},{"Item1":"Day 15: Kampala","Item2":"Back in Kampala for only one day before going to Jinja Uganda, I was again on my own and used this time to visit a few places I still had on my list:\nCafe PAP on Parliament Avenue where I had lunch, milkshake and coffee. I particularly recommend the place, even if it is bit expensive by local standards (UGX 4,000 / € 1,20 for an espresso or UGX 21,000 / € 6 for a sandwich), especially for the coffee that is divine and also for the sandwiches, which are amongst the best in town. You'll mostly seat next to expats, local businessmen and politicians.\n                             \n                               Uganda Museum, located on Kira Road. I had a nice visit there but it's better to know in advance that you are not going to the British Museum. While collections of artifacts and other objects are truly interesting, most of them are not properly highlighted and lack explanations (October 2014). You'll certainly learn a lot there and this would be stupid to skip it as it is the oldest Museum in East Africa; it is just sad to see so little invested in the country's cultural promotion although tourism is currently booming. Entrance is UGX 5,000."},{"Item1":"Day 16: Jinja Uganda - Source of the Nile, Uganda","Item2":"For my last full day before flying back to Paris, I went to Jinja Uganda to see the source of the Nile. This is a popular destination in Uganda for backpackers and adventure tourists, especially for white water rafting (Class V level: Expert). Leaving Kampala early in the morning, I took a matatu (see note on transportations at the bottom) to go from Kampala to Jinja. The distance is not gigantic (80 km) but the traffic is quite dense in the morning and at the end of the afternoon. Add to that the numerous stops made by the matatu to drop off passengers and then take new ones, and you'll get a good 3-hour journey to reach Jinja.\nOnce there, however, all accumulated stress disappears and you get quickly used to the peaceful atmosphere of the town. I had breakfast at 2 Friends Restaurant, which is a very nice place with many seating spaces disseminated in a cosy courtyard. Shortly after, I took a boda-boda to go and finally admire the sources of the Nile. Located approximately 2 to 3 km from the city center, the east banks of the source of the Nile are the most easy to reach and thus the one with the most tourist shops! That being said, it is very nice to go there and you'll love to peacefully sip your Nile Special (local beer) just above the water, in the overwater restaurants. Nile Special is arguably the best beer in East Africa and it is produced here in Jinja. You can even visit the Nile breweries if booked in advance.\nThe west banks take a bit longer to reach as you need to drive further to cross the Nile. Both locations are beautiful and everything is made so you feel fine! You can read some mixed reviews here and there, but lots of things have been improved in the past years.\n                             \n                               My plan was then to walk from the east banks to the JSC (Jinja Sailing Club). The walk was very nice with interesting views over the golf course and some stunning villas! The JSC itself is a very modern complex with a restaurant, a cocktail bar and boating services (boat rides on the Nile and on Lake Victoria). The view on the Nile is just amazing and the garden is really well arranged with possibility to have lunch near the water!\nI ended up the day walking in Jinja Uganda, to explore the city and the many art and craft shops located at the heart of the city. Some nice craft objects and paintings can be found.\nI came back to Kampala using a matatu, the \"station\" is located near the Total service station."},{"Item1":"Day 17: On the shore of Lake Victoria - Kampala","Item2":"The end! For my very last day in Kampala (and in Uganda...), I had kept two things on my to-do list:\nThe Ggaba road fish market on the northern shores of Lake Victoria (the second largest freshwater lake in the world). Located around 25/30 mins away (via boda-boda) from Kampala's city center, the Ggaba road fish market is a must-do. You'll see fishermen coming back from the lake with their boat full of Nile perch (a fish species introduced in the lake that has, however, altered the ecosystem &amp; driven many species to near extinction). On the market you'll be amazed to see how vibrant and colorful everything is, especially the fish auction. This is really the perfect spot for taking beautiful pictures.\n                             \n                               In the afternoon, I went to Uganda Arts &amp; Crafts Village to find souvenirs. It is located behind the National Theatre, in central Kampala. You'll find various handicrafts made by local craftsmen, ranging from wood carvings, leather items, Ugandan shirts and dresses, to paintings and photographs. Be picky, as there is a mix of very nice handicraft but also \"kitsch\" objects (the usual tourist gifts like (funny or not) tee-shirts or fridge magnets).\nI also bought Ugandan coffee, as beans are good-quality robusta. Coffee is the country's most-produced export crop. Also, Ugandan vanilla has a reputation to be amongst the best in the world. It is however quite hard to find it in the grocery shops, as almost all of it is exported."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/german-fairy-tale-route-road-trip-brothers-grimm/","Title":"Dream road trip on the German Fairy Tale Route","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["Europe","Germany"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Books","Culture","Legendary","Nature","RoadTrip"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"The Grimm Brothers","Item2":"Hanau to Kassel\nThe German Fairy Tale Route starts in Hanau, the birthplace of the Brothers Grimm. It then continues with Steinau where you can visit the childhood home of the two brothers Jacob and Wilhelm.\nAnother interesting destination not to miss on the way is the medieval town of Alsfeld where the Fairy Tale House (see photo) and the House of Little Red Riding Hood are located.\n                             \n                               The area stretching from Alsfeld to Fritzlar is known as Little Red Riding Hood land and with its beautiful forests and lakes it's not difficult to see how it inspired the imagination of the Grimm Brothers.\nFinally, make sure to stop in Bad Wildungen: presented as Snow White's village, there's a museum dedicated to this wonderful tale as well as Snow White's presumed dwarven home."},{"Item1":"Option 1: Mother Hulda","Item2":"Kassel to Fürstenberg\nOnce you arrive in Kassel there are two possible route options to reach Fürstenberg. The first one is dedicated to Mother Hulda. It's a bit of a detour in comparison to the Sleeping Beauty alternative but it's definitely a good one, especially if you like hiking.\nBefore choosing one route or another (or both), take some time to visit the beautiful town of Kassel where the Brothers Grimm spent thirty years of their life and that now preciously keeps the original Children’s and Household Tales (known today as Grimm’s Fairy Tales) first published in 1812. Not particularly related to the Brothers Grimm but still right in the world of myths and legends, one of the most beautiful landmarks of Kassel is its Hercules monument dedicated to the ancient Greek demigod Heracles (see photo).\n                             \n                               Back on the road, the Mother Hulda route passes nearby Hoher Meissner Mountain, a stunning mountain massif in the Meissner Kaufunger nature park in Hesse. There you can admire the famous pond that inspired the story of the Brothers Grimm's Mother Hulda tale.\nOn the Mother Hulda route there's also the village of Ebergötzen with the Wilhelm Busch Mill, a museum presenting the life and work of Wilhelm Busch where you can visit the mill from the story of Max and Moritz and reproduce a few of their pranks if you dare."},{"Item1":"Option 2: Sleeping Beauty","Item2":"Kassel to Fürstenberg\nThe other option to reach Fürstenberg from Kassel is the Sleeping Beauty route. Although Hoher Meissner makes the Mother Hulda route very attractive (see above), we have a preference for the Sleeping Beauty route because it goes through the magnificent wooded hills of Reinhardswald.\nWith its dense forests and majestic valleys that render the most incredible colours in Autumn, Reinhardswald is the quintessence of the Brothers Grimm's world of fairy tales and legends. Nothing like a walk through the beautiful ancient oak trees of Reinhardswald woods to invoke the most romantic dreams of princesses, witches and dwarves in your mind.\n                             \n                               The highlight of the Sleeping Beauty route is Sababurg Castle (see photo). This 650-year old castle known as Sleeping Beauty Castle is believed to be the home of the princess in the tale by the Brothers Grimm."},{"Item1":"Pied Piper of Hamelin & other tales","Item2":"Fürstenberg to Bremen\nThe last leg of this road trip on the German Fairy Tale Route is between Fürstenberg and Bremen. The most famous destination on the way is Hamelin where the story of The Pied Piper of Hamelin takes place. The tale of the pied piper getting rid of rats by enchanting them with his flute is not the only reason to visit Hamelin though for it is quite a picturesque village with charming hills (see photo).\n                             \n                               Finally, the last destination of this road trip is Bremen, one of the largest German cities. Bremen is part of this trip because of the Brothers Grimm' story The Town Musicians of Bremen, although in this folktale the musicians never actually make it to Bremen."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/batman-begins-filming-locations-itinerary/","Title":"Batman Begins filming locations and itinerary","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["Asia","East Asia","China","Tibet","Europe","Northern Europe","Iceland","Southern Region","Vatnajökull National Park","United Kingdom","Buckinghamshire","Mentmore Towers","England","Essex","Coalhouse Fort","Port of Tilbury","North America","Abbey Mills Pumping Station","CityPoint","ExCel","Farmiloe Building","Garrick Theatre","National Institute for Medical Research","Plateau restaurant","St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel London","Chicago","Chicago Board of Trade Building","Chicago Loop","Franklin Street Bridge","Jewelers Building","Illinois"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Adventure","Legendary","Movies","Urban"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Prison in Bhutan","Item2":"Coalhouse Fort, East Tilbury, Essex, United Kingdom\nBatman Begins starts in Bhutan where Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is locked up for some petty theft as part of his full immersion in the underworld of criminals.

The weather being desperately grey and rainy, we thought our best option was to be indoor. \nOceanopolis is quite a thing, it is one of the biggest aquarium in Europe. With three distinct halls/pavilions for Polar, Tropical and Temperate zones (as well as an area dedicated to biodiversity), Oceanopolis has more than 10,000 animals and marine plants and over 1,000 species. The center has modern infrastructure, great educational materials and is especially well-adapted for children. A full visit can take up 4 to 6 hours (especially with children) but we did it in about 2 without missing much.\nFollowing our visit, we drove from Brest to Morgat. The road is really nice and you can stop at numerous occasions to admire the view. We stopped once at a local cider production farm called La Maison du Cidre de Bretagne, as we had previously seen we could get a tour of the farm and a cider degustation!\n                             \n                               The tour was really good and the guide, who happens to be the founder of the farm, is extremely knowledgeable.

Nothing too commercial, only clear explanations and some chemistry :) We ended up the tour with a great degustation led by the guide. We obviously ended up buying a few bottles...\nWe finally drove the last kilometers to Morgat and reached the place where we were staying at the end of the afternoon. A very nice room in a villa, found on Airbnb, just above the waterfront and 5 minutes away from the city center.\nIn the evening, we had dinner at Saveur et Marée, a restaurant on the seafront with a gorgeous view.

With a beautiful weather and light hiking gear, we started to walk at around 11 am. The area is truly stunning: you hike on the top of the land with a beautiful view over the ocean and the coasts.

In spite of what its name suggests, Ile Vierge is not an island. It is a fabulous beach with crystal clear water, beautiful surroundings and an awesome view. To get there, you'll need to go down from the top of the hiking path to the beach, using a narrow, steep and sometimes slippery passage. Nothing crazy though... Once you're there, it's the paradise so it's definitely worth the descent! Another way to reach this isolated beach is to rent a kayak or an inflatable boat and to paddle from the beach in Morgat to there. After tanning and swimming for an hour or two, we went back on the path and finished the few kilometers left to Morgat. We can only recommend this hike, it is truly awesome!\nIn the evening, we had dinner at l'Oceanic, a nice pizzeria in Crozon."},{"Item1":"Road tripping the peninsula","Item2":"On our third day, we took the car and drove to different locations on the peninsula.

Hard to find somewhere more peaceful! The crêperie is very good!\nDriving north, we reached the Espagnols headland where you will find a stunning panoramic view of Brest's natural harbour. What a wonderful point of view! You can also visit some of the defensive fortifications built there from 1812 to Napoleon's abdication in 1814, such as a well-preserved Napoleon tower. Those were built to defend Brest and its access to the sea against the British and their powerful war vessels.\n                             \n                               For lunch, we stopped in Camaret-sur-Mer, which is quite famous for its port, artists (many painting / art galleries) and the Tour Vauban (\"Golden Tower\"), a historic fortification guarding the harbor and built in the 17th century by the famous architect. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWe then drove to the Pointe de Penhir, which is very well known for the rock formation in the sea called the 'tas de pois' (= heaps of peas). Don't forget your camera, the scenery is truly beautiful.\nAt the end of the afternoon, we drove to the Palud Plage, which features a spectacular, wild landscape and dramatic coastline. It is also known as the surfers' beach. You won't find many swimmers, but if you're interested in surfing, that's definitely where you need to go!\nFor dinner, we went to the Bar Crêperie Atao Aman in Morgat.

We found the Shinobazu Pond especially amazing with its little boats and huge lotuses. Surrounded by the city buildings, it really has a unique feel. Just before lunch we then walked to Nezu.

It's quite a bit of fun to explore the area with all its game arcades and anime buildings stretching on many floors that you need to reach through tiny escalators. Some of the games are really addictive, no matter how obscure they may look at first.\nIn the evening, we had a walk in Shibuya and finally witnessed and experienced the legendary crossing where as many as 2,500 people can cross at the same time! For dinner we went to a Shabu Shabu place where you get unlimited meat and vegetables for two hours.  There's also an all-you-can-drink beer formula in case you are thirsty ;)"},{"Item1":"Day 3: Tokyo | Tsukiji Market, Hamarikyu Gardens","Item2":"We started our third day in Tokyo by visiting Tsukiji Market where some of the biggest tunas in the world are auctioned every morning. We didn't go to the tuna auction as you have to be there very early to get a spot (before 4 AM from what we have read). Instead we arrived at Tsukiji Market around 9 AM and enjoyed some delicious sushi breakfast. The most famous sushi places at Tsukiji Market are Sushi Dai and Daiwa Sushi but they fill up pretty fast so in order not to wait we opted for Sushisay where we had the freshest and tastiest sushis of our life yet. For the sake of the experience make sure to pick the chef's platter to discover new types of sushi. In our case we were surprised to find so many types of tuna sushi (they vary depending on how fat they are).\nAfter this sushi breakfast we visited the Tsukiji Market. After the tuna auction early in the morning, the market opens again its doors to the general public from 9:00 AM. Access is not allowed to all the areas – make sure to grab a map at the entrance to know where you can and cannot go. This is a place of work and there are many mini-trucks driving around so be very aware of your surrounding.\nNext to Tsukiji Market are the beautiful Hamarikyu Gardens so we went there for a walk. With its magnificent trees cut in the tradition of Japanese gardens surrounded by the buildings of the city, this is easily one of the highlights of our trip. We even preferred it to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden but maybe that's because we were in Hamarikyu quite early so the gardens were very peaceful. In the middle of the gardens is a very nice tea house where you can enjoy matcha green tea.\n                             \n                               After that we went to the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower for a breathtaking panomara of Tokyo. We also visited the Mori Arts Center and Art Museum in the same building (the ticket gives you access to the observation point and the museum).\nFor lunch we enjoyed some delicious gyozas at Harajuku Gyozaro in Omotesando.\nWe used the rest of the day to chill and do some shopping in Omotesando and Harajuku. We also had great coffee at Omotesando Koffee. The place is very popular though so we had to wait a bit.\nIn the evening we visited Shinjuku and tried Okonomiyaki – delicious savoury pancakes that you can customize to your liking – for the first time. Finally, we had some drinks in one of the little bars of Golden Gai. This area is very picturesque and definitely had a Blade Runner feel – the alleys of Golden Gai allegedly served as inspiration for Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi classic."},{"Item1":"Day 4: Tokyo | Chilling in Shimokitazawa and Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden","Item2":"Our fourth day in Tokyo was quite laid back. In the morning we just walked around in Shinjuku and Gyoen National Garden. The park is quite impressive and just like with New York's Central Park you get this feeling of urban jungle with the skyscrapers surrounding nature.\nWe had lunch in Shibuya at Ippudo Shiromaru Base. We went there because of the recommendation from a friend as well as good online reviews but we didn't really like it. We had the ramen with pork and egg and it was just really too fat.\n                             \n                               In the afternoon we went off the beaten path and headed to Shimokitazawa, a hip neighborhood in the west of Tokyo (about 15 minutes by train from Shibuya). Shimokitazawa is full of indie clothing shops and coffee places, to the extent that some have started calling it the 'Williamsburg of Tokyo'. There's not necessarily more choice than in Omotesando or Shibuya but the atmosphere is definitely worth it.\nIn the evening we indulged in some fried food at the Gaburi Chicken just near our hotel."},{"Item1":"Days 5-6: Kamikochi 'Japanese Alps'","Item2":"On the 5th day (Thursday) of this trip to Japan in 2 weeks we took a train to Matsumoto, then another one followed by a bus to reach Kamikōchi. For our first venture outside of Tokyo we were quite surprised of how easy and smooth it was to get there.\nKamikōchi is a high mountain valley in the Hida Mountains that are part of the Japanese Alps. Kamikōchi is about 18 km (11.1 mi) long and between 1,400 m (4,600 ft) and 1,600 m (5,200 ft) high.\nIt was undoubtedly one of the places we were longing to visit the most, because of all the pictures we had seen while preparing our trip.  We were not disappointed – the scenery is beautiful with amazing autumnal colors.\nWe arrived in Kamikōchi around midday and after dropping our bags and getting a quick lunch we started hiking the valley. The weather was perfect: sunny with a nice breeze to keep us fresh. We hiked the northern part of Kamikōchi until the Myojin Pond and then went back on the other side of the Azusa River to explore the southern part and Taisho Pond. The mix of autumn foliage, Japanese vegetation and mountain scenery was stunning and unlike anything we had seen before.\nThe valley is mostly flat and the trail is not difficult at all so it's really accessible to everyone. We noticed that most people were wearing bells on their backpack and we should have understood why when we saw bear warning signs. Especially around Taisho Pond there's a sign indicating that a bear has been spotted there. It was getting dark and there were not so many people so we started to worry a little but fortunately we didn't encounter any furry creatures.\n                             \n                               We spent the night at Kamikochi Nishi-Ito-Ya-Sanso in a traditional Japanese room. The highlight was undoubtedly the dinner with a florilège of dishes including fresh fish from Kamikōchi. Like with most places in Japan it's recommended to book in advance. We did so by email and only had to pay upon arrival.\nThe next day we got up early and reached the end of the trail in the northern part of Kamikōchi. This is where the trails to reach the surrounding mountains start. If we had time we would have loved to stay a couple of extra days to hike one of those mountain trails. Funnily on the way back we were interviewed by a Japanese TV channel. After the usual questions like where are you from, why did you come to Kamikōchi, they asked us about 'Karasawa'. We first thought of the famous director Kurosawa – did he ever film in Kamikōchi?? – but they informed us it was a very famous mountain in the Japanese Alps. This put a stop to the interview. The anchorwoman and her team  obviously wanted to gather our impressions on this natural landmark but we shamefully had never heard of it. If only we had read a bit more about the place! Needless to say we felt a bit dumb. Hopefully we haven't become some kind of meme in Japan by now – that is if our feat ever aired on TV.\nIn the afternoon we returned to Matsumoto and travelled to Kyoto (with a transfer in Nagoya) where we arrived late in the evening."},{"Item1":"Days 7: Kyoto | Southern Higashiyama and Gion","Item2":"We started our visit of Kyoto with Tainai-Meguri (gate) and Kiyomizu-dera, a beautiful temple perched on a hill with breathtaking views.\nWe then walked on the busy but charming street Sannen-zaka and stopped at Kasagi Ya for a nice tea break with delicious Japanese sweets like rice cakes with shaved ice (kakigōri).\nAfter that we continued exploring Higashiyama with Murayama-kōen (park) and Shōren-in, another buddhist temple. \nNote that there are many temples to visit in Kyoto but each visit can take quite some time so you may want to make a selection beforehand in order not to rush and take the time to appreciate each temple. This is what a Japanese friend from Kyoto recommended to us before our trip and we soon realized it was the good approach to visit Kyoto in three days.\n                             \n                               In the evening we headed to Gion the geisha and entertainment district of Kyoto where many restaurants are located. We had another delicious okonomiyaki in Gion Tanto.\nIn Kyoto we stayed at the lovely Ryokan of Ms. Uemura who have been welcoming guests in her home for over thirty years. The place is ideally located in southern Higashiyama just next to the beautiful street Ishibei-koji. This area was magical and embodied exactly how we imagined cute traditional Japanese streets. Ryokan Uemura represented the quintessential authentic Japanese experience with its rustic but very comfortable facilities. It was a pleasure to chat with Ms. Uemura every day and to enjoy a great breakfast in the morning before heading for a full day of walking. Note that there's a curfew at 22:00 so we had to plan our evenings accordingly."},{"Item1":"Day 8: Kyoto | Golden & Silver Pavilion Temples, Philosopher's Walk","Item2":"On our second day in Kyoto we started early in the morning by visiting the Golden Pavilion Temple (Kinkaku-ji) located in the northeast part of the city. Kinkaku-ji is Kyoto's most famous temple and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful. It also has a fascinating story: the temple was burned to the ground by a schizophrenic monk obsessed by its beauty. The visit is quite quick as you can only see the temple from outside but it's definitely worth it. Kinkaku-ji was stunning at this time of the year with the autumn foliage perfectly blending with the golden colors of the temple. We have seen pictures of the Golden Pavilion Temple in the snow and it also looked breathtaking so we may come back if we ever visit Japan during winter.\nAfter that we struggled our way back by bus to Higashiyama and had a great lunch at Omen. It was one of the best meals of our trip: Omen serves delicious soba (noodles) dishes with a very subtle and hearty mix of vegetables. Highly recommended!\nWe then visited Ginkaku-ji (aka Jishō-ji), the Temple of the Silver Pavilion. It was easily our favorite temple experience in Kyoto with its magnificent zen garden. There was something incredibly calming and inspiring about this visit. I guess each temple is likely to touch everyone differently and Ginkaku-ji really hit a special chord with us.\n                             \n                               After that we followed the legendary Philosopher's Walk leading us to visit more temples like Honen-in and Anraku-ji. Tokyo's iconic pedestrian path is famous for its cherry trees so, unfortunately, it was not that impressive in November. This is just one more good reasons to come back to Japan for the cherry blossoms season!\nTo conclude this day we had a nice dinner at Shishin Samurai Cafe & Bar & Restaurant (Samurai Restaurant). Despite its name that made us fear a tourist trap, the place felt very authentic with its dim-light atmosphere and samurai artefacts everywhere. The concept is very well-thought of with the dishes and drinks on the menu pertaining to famous samurais like Yamaoka Tesshū (I highly recommend the great biography of this great sword warrior by John Stevens, The Sword of No Sword). Although warmed up rather than cooked on spot, the food was very tasty and the selection of sake was also very nice."},{"Item1":"Day 9: Kyoto | Fushimi Inari-taisha, Arashiyama (bamboo forest)","Item2":"For our third and last day in Kyoto, we started by visiting the Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine, Kyoto's most famous attraction, even more so since it was featured in Memoirs of a Geisha (2005). The shrine is famous for its many red gates (torii) leading to various shrines up a small mountain. The climb reaches 233 metres (764 ft) and spans 4 kilometers (2.5 miles). The whole circuit takes about 2 hours to complete.\nIn the afternoon, after having some tasty soba lunch we visited the Bamboo forest, Arashiyama, located in the southwest part of Kyoto. The walk was really amazing with a path surrounded by bamboos so thick and so high you can barely see the sky. At the end of the bamboo road is Ōkōchi Sansō, the former home and garden of Japanese actor Denjirō Ōkōchi famous in the 20s. The garden is especially stunning and offers a breathtaking view of Kyoto. You can also enjoy a complimentary matcha green tea offered with the entry ticket to the garden.\n                             \n                               Finally, to conclude our stay in Kyoto we enjoyed our first yakiniku in Japan at Kyo no Yakinikudokoro Hiro Sembon Sanjo Honten. Yakiniku consists of grilling meat and vegetable dishes on a grill with charcoal placed in the middle of the table. It's very similar to Korean barbecue although you may want to refrain from bringing this up."},{"Item1":"Day 10: Koyasan","Item2":"After Kyoto we continued our 2-week trip to Japan with Kōyasan, one of the most prominent epicentres of Buddhism in Japan. Kōyasan is the home of Shingon sect founded by Kōbō-Daishi  in 805.\nThe trip to Kōyasan from Kyoto was not too difficult albeit a few changes: you first need to reach Osaka and then from there Shin-Imamiya to Gokurakubashi (Kōyasan train station). There are limited express and normal trains to Gokurakubashi. The former is faster but more expensive than the latter (and also less frequent). After that you still have to take a cable car to climb the mountain Kōyasan lies on and a bus to reach the town's centre.\nWe arrived around midday and went to the temple where we were going to stay for the night to drop off our bags. We then had lunch at one of the restaurants in the center of Kōyasan near the tourist office for yet another one of those homy Tonkatsu dishes (rice with eggs and pork cutlets).\n                             \n                               We spent the rest of the day visiting the different temples of Kōyasan. We were especially impressed by the Konpon Daito Pagoda with its joyful bright orange color. In the evening we returned to our temple (Kumagaiji) located just near to the Okunoin cemetery.\nAfter a good Buddhist dinner, entirely vegetarian with a lot of tofu, we had a walk in the Okunoin cemetery at night.  Okunoin is the mausoleum of Kōbō-Daishi. It is surrounded by the largest graveyard in Japan. Walking there at night was a fascinating experience, especially because we were almost alone in the alleys of the cemetery. The path to the mausoleum is actually rather long (about 3km) so you have time to get lost in your thoughts and reflect on those thousands souls resting in peace – according to Buddhism the dead are in a state of eternal meditation. The mausoleum itself is very impressive, especially with all the beautiful lanterns surrounding the edifice. We came back the next day and it was just not the same with the crowds of tourists swarming the place and sun shining instead of the intimacy of the night."},{"Item1":"Day 11 (morning): Hiroshima","Item2":"After Kōyasan we headed to Hiroshima by train via Osaka. Hiroshima is sadly known as the place where the first atomic bombing in history took place, claiming the lives of over 140,000 people.\nWe arrived late in the evening and went straight to our hotel. We picked the Grand Prince Hotel Hiroshima because of its location just near the water and Hiroshima's port – we thought it would be practical to reach Miyajima island the next day. However, we soon found out that it was actually quite remote from the city center (at least 20 minutes by tramway) and on top of that we learned that the Japan Rail boats to Miyajima (free with the Japan Railway Pass) departed from another location. Nonetheless, the breathtaking view of our room over Hiroshima Bay largely made up for those inconveniences. For dinner we had the best okonomiyaki of our trip at Nagataya!\n                             \n                               The next day we visited briefly Hiroshima in the morning. We started with Genbaku dome. The atomic bomb exploded directly overhead of this building that caused it to keep its structure intact while almost everything else around within a radius of 1 mile was entirely destroyed. The building has since been preserved as Hiroshima Peace Memorial.\nAfter that we visited Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum which was a really poignant experience. The museum covers all the aspects of the tragedy: the immediate consequences of the atomic bombing but also the lifelong effects of radiations on survivors and the following generations. The story of Sadako Sasaki is especially heart-wrenching. She was two years old when the atomic bomb hit Hiroshima and died ten years later from leukemia by radiation exposure. Just outside the museum is the Children's Peace Monument commemorating Sadako and the thousands of child victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima."},{"Item1":"Day 11-12: Miyajima Island (Itsukushima)","Item2":"After visiting Hiroshima, we reached the beautiful island of Miyajima in the afternoon. We had to take a train to Miyajimaguchi in order to get there for free by ferry with our JR passes.\nThe sacred island of Miyajima (Itsukushima) is famous for its giant gate (Torii) that serves as entrance to the Shrine of the island. The stunningly massive gate seems to float at high tide and when the water recedes it's possible to reach it by walking. This reminded us of the Mont Saint-Michel in France that we love and indeed the two destinations have been twinned since 2009.\nWe were blessed to be able to admire the island and the gate at sunset with a gorgeous pastel and orange colored sky. We then had a delicious dinner at Mametanuki where we ate huge steam oysters and a delicious assortment of sashimi. We also tried the local beer of Miyajima and it was probably the best one we had in Japan.\nThat night the Itsukushima Shrine was exceptionally open and there was a captivating spectacle of Kagura (Shinto theatrical dance) – or at least we think that's what it was.\n                             \n                               After a good night sleep at guest house Mizuhasou (highly recommended), we took up the challenge of climbing Mont Misen, the sacred mountain of the island. There are different hiking trails leading up to the top of Mont Misen and we picked the Omoto Route because we wanted to go through the Komaga Forest and its large fir trees. This took us a bit more than one hour and a half – the climb is quite steep but very doable. However, just like in Kamikōchi we were scared by another warning sign: no bear this time but snakes! This spoiled our fun a bit as we were literally scrutinizing our every step.\nThe view from the top of Mount Misen over the Hiroshima Bay was stunning and even more appreciated after the climb. We descended back to the town center of Miyajima through the Momiji Dani Route along the Momiji River.\nWe then said our goodbyes to Miyajima and the many deer that stroll all over the island to return to Tokyo."},{"Item1":"Days 13-14: back to Tokyo","Item2":"Back in Tokyo for a couple of days before our flight home, we mostly went shopping for nice sneakers and souvenirs for friends and family.\nWe also visited the famous jazz bar DUG that is featured in the novel Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami where we tried out different Japanese whiskys.\n                             \n                               &nbsp;"}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/kenya-safari-national-parks-tropical-valley-sponsored/","Title":"Kenya Safari in National Parks (5 days) [sponsored]","SubTitle":"Amazing Safari in Kenya's Aberdares, Lake Nakuru and Maasai Mara National Parks","Destinations":["Africa","Aberdare National Park","Nairobi","Nakuru","Narok","Kenya","Lake Nakuru National Park","Maasai Mara National Reserve"],"Duration":"5 days","Themes":["Adventure","Nature"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Day 1: Aberdare National Park","Item2":"We will pick you up at your hotel or at the airport in Nairobi and drive you to Aberdare National Park, in the central Kenya highlands region.

With an ultra bright and sunny weather, and after a delicious hot chocolate at the hotel, we decided to start right away our 3 days in Rome itinerary!\nWe first walked from our hotel to the Circus Maximus and the Roman Forum... What a vision! The Circus Maximus is an ancient chariot racing stadium and you can really imagine the scale of the events that took place here. Now a public park, the Circus could accommodate over 150,000 spectators back then! After taking pictures and admiring the Circus and the Roman Forum, we then kept on walking to reach the Colosseum...\nAs the largest amphitheatre ever built, the Colosseum is .. impressive! With a capacity of around 80,000 spectators, it was mostly used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. We turned around this historic landmark and decided that we would get in and visit the monument after lunch. Not too far away, we found a nice little restaurant: Taverna Romana. Food was excellent and the house wine did a great job!\n                             \n                               We came back to the Colosseum right after our lunch and were pleased to see a short waiting line: we got in in less than 15 minutes! We spent at least 2 hours inside, reading more about its construction and how it was used throughout the years. We took awesome pictures with the sun illuminating the monument with yellow/orange colors.\nAt the end of the afternoon on our way back to the hotel, we randomly found the key hole (Il Buco della serratura) on the Piazza Pietro d'Iliiria. Through this door keyhole, you are able to see a stunning view of the Basilica in the distance with two rows of the garden’s trees at the foreground.\nIn the evening, we had dinner at an amazing trattoria: L’Oasi della Birra. Call us crazy but this might be our best (culinary) memory of Rome! Amazing choice of delicatessen, cheese, beers and wine, alongside other Italian dishes we all crave for..."},{"Item1":"Exploring further: from the The Altare della Patria to the Pantheon and the Tiber","Item2":"Our second day in Rome started well with a gargantuan breakfast at the hotel .. and still a splendid weather. After leaving the hotel, we walked in direction of the Monument of the Unknown Soldier, at the altar of the Fatherland in Rome. Located near the Piazza Venezia, the \"Altare della Patria\" is really an impressive monument. Note that there is a panoramic elevator that allows visitors go on the roof and enjoy a 360 degree views of Rome.\nA bit further we discovered the Trajan's Column and the Forum. Once considered as one of the architectural wonders of the world, the Forum ruins are beautiful. It consisted of a basilica, two libraries, markets and a large temple.\nFrom the Forum, we walked to the Piazza della Repubblica, which is surrounded by impressive buildings and has a nice fountain at the center. \nOur plan was then to finally see the Trevi fountain! Considered as the most beautiful and famous fountains in the world, the Trevi Fountain truly deserves its reputation... You just HAVE to see this one once in your life. Note that it can be quite challenging to take pictures as the place is so crowded.\n                             \n                               Let's emphasize that any 3 days in Rome itinerary should have the Trevi Fountain included!\nWe then kept on exploring and went to the Pantheon, which is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings. The interior is splendid and, thanks to the awesome weather, we were able to see the beam of light coming through the dome of the Pantheon.\nWe then walked to the beautiful Piazza Navona, just before having lunch in a little restaurant nearby.\nFollowing this, we kept on exploring and walking in the tiny streets around, discovering shops, markets and small churches. We then pushed further and reached the Tiber that we followed to reach the Isola Tiberina. This beautiful little island on the river Tiber hosts the Basilica San Bartolomeo all'Isola.\nIn the evening we had great pizzas and Italian wine at the Il Grottino restaurant."},{"Item1":"Vatican City - A Tour in the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church","Item2":"Our last day was focused on the Vatican! We had an early breakfast at our hotel and took a cab to the the Vatican City.\nAs soon as you arrive, you are impressed by the splendor of St. Peter's Square and the Basilica! This is simply stunning. The walk from the beginning of the street \"Via della Conciliazione\" to St. Peter's Square is pretty incredible. Then, there is this unique square that symbolizes the stretched arms of the church embracing the world.\nWe got into the waiting line and it took us around 30 to 40 minutes to get screened and then be able to visit the Basilica.\n                             \n                               St. Peter's Basilica itself is a pure marvel of the world. A mix of Renaissance and Baroque architecture, the church is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. We spent quite a long time inside admiring the statues, sculptures and the general architecture, and then went down in the Vatican grotto beneath the Basilica.\nWe also tried to visit the Vatican Museums, but we could not as they only accepted cash. Too bad for us; this gives us an excellent reason to come back!\nAfter the Basilica, we walked around a bit and found a nice pizzeria for lunch.

The first destination on the program is Stari Grad (litterally Old Town), the oldest city in Croatia. The most ancient part of Stari Grad (Stari Grad Plain or Starogradsko polje) is a UNESCO protected World Heritage Site that you should definitely visit along with the other archeological sites around the town like the Old Town Walls (fortress). There are also many churches like the Church of St Peter (Petar) and the Church of St. Luke (Lucije).\n                             \n                               Then reach the city and port of Hvar.\nThe main sightseeing spots in Hvar city are the Cathedral of St. Stephen (Sv.

This will allow you to enjoy the very nice coast drive from Split to Dubrovnik where you can spend the night."},{"Item1":"Day 7: Dubrovnik, Croatia","Item2":"Dubrovnik is for many people the highlight of any trip in Southeastern Europe/Balkans. Dubrovnik, also referred to as the 'Pearl of the Adriatic', has been a UNESCO protected World Heritage Site since 1979. For your first day there you could already visit the main attractions like the Sponza Palace, the Rector's Palace and the St. Saviour's Church.\n                             \n                                Have a look also at the massive Walls of Dubrovnik that surround the city for about 2 km and are up to six metres thick. If you are looking for a nice walk in the sun or a swim in the Adriatic sea, check out Lapad Beach located about 3.5 km from the old town."},{"Item1":"Day 8: Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Item2":"This day is dedicated to the visit of a beautiful city, Mostar, located in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Herzegovina region) about 3 hours away by car from Dubrovnik. It may actually take a bit longer because you need to cross a EU border so it's really advised to leave early in the morning. Mostar is especially famous for its Stari Most (Old Bridge) over the Neretva which was built in the 16th Century by the Ottomans and is considered nowadays one of the most spectacular pieces of islamic architecture in the Balkans. \n                             \n                               Besides the Old Bridge and its surrounding area (Old City of Mostar) you should also have a look at the Partisan Memorial Cemetery and the Koski Mehmed Paša Mosque (oldest mosque in Mostar - built in 1617). Finally, if you still have time and like nature you can try to check out the Kravice Falls on the Trebižat River (about 40 km south of Mostar) on the way back to Dubrovnik."},{"Item1":"Day 9: Kotor, Montenegro","Item2":"Drop off your rental car before taking a bus to reach Herceg Novi in Montenegro (about 1h30). There pick up the rental car and after quickly visiting  the city (if you wish to) head to Kotor (1-hour drive). Kotor is a superb coastal city located in the Bay of Kotor. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site 'Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor'. You should visit there the Old Town of Kotor and the City Walls. It's highly recommended to climb up to reach  St. Ivan's Fortress (280 metres / 918 feet high) where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of Kotor and the bay.\n                             \n                               This requires some hiking but the view at the top is definitely worth it and altogether it shouldn't take you more than 2 hours and a half for the round journey. Also, don't miss the Chapel of our Lady of Salvation on the way to St. Ivan's Fortress.\nIf you still have time after this, head to Perast (a village 15 minutes away from Kotor by car) and take a boat to reach Our Lady of the Rocks, a little islet in the Bay of Kotor where you can see the beautiful Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rocks. For the night you can either sleep in Kotor or proceed to the next destination: Budva."},{"Item1":"Day 10: Budva, Montenegro","Item2":"Budva is a small town (18,000 inhabitants) located about 23 km / 14.3 mi south east of Kotor. It is especially famous for its nightlife so you may want to spend at least one night there. Apart from this you should visit the Stari Grad (Old Town) and its Citadel at the southern part as well as the many churches like Saint John, Holy Trinity and Saint Sava.\n                             \n                               Budva is one of the oldest town of the Adriatic coast and goes back to 500 BC so if you are interested in history and archeology you may want to visit Budva Archeology Museum."},{"Item1":"Day 11: Sveti Stefan, Bar, Rijeka Crnojevića, Podgorica (Montenegro)","Item2":"This day is a busy one, it covers not one but three spots! First, Sveti Stefan, an islet and luxury resort. Access is restricted to hotel guests but the beaches located north and south of the island are open to public. Then, continue with Bar and especially its Old Town (Stari Bar). Other interesting sights are the port of Bar, Bar Fortress and, last but not least, the oldest Olive tree in the world. \n                             \n                               The next destination is Rijeka Crnojevića, a small historical city located on the oldest trade route that goes through Montenegro. The most interesting things to see are the old bridge of the town and the fortresses. The Lake Skadar on which Rikeja Crnojevića is located is also a beautiful sight.\nFinally, spend the evening and night in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro. The main attractions there are the Old Turkish town (Stara Varoš) and the Ribnica Bridge (Adži-paša's bridge / Most na Ribnici)."},{"Item1":"Day 12: Durmitor, Montenegro","Item2":"It is now time to have another taste of nature and experience the beauty of a wonderful national park – Durmitor – that doesn't have anything to envy of its Croatian counterparts like Plitvice. Durmitor is a montainous area (massif) that holds the highest peak of Montenegro (Bobotov Kuk at 2,522 meters).\n                             \n                               This itinerary dedicates only one day to Durmitor and Žabljak, a town at the center of Durmitor situated at 1,456 metres which makes it the highest town on the Balkans. If you would like to have time for activities like hiking, biking or rafting on the Tara River (Drina) (UNESCO World Heritage Site), you may want to skip one of the previous destinations to enjoy two days in Durmitor."},{"Item1":"Days 13-14: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Item2":"This is almost the end of this itinerary. Say goodbye to Montenegro and drop off the rental car back in Podgorica before taking a bus to Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The bus departs from Lukavica station and the ride takes about 7 hours but the surrounding nature on the way is so beautiful that you will not be wasting your time at all. \n                             \n                               Sarajevo is a very interesting town and one could spend easily a full week there just to explore the different museums so at this stage of the itinerary it is really up to you how long you want to stay there. In any case, be sure not to miss the Old Town and its bazaar (Baščaršija), the Latin Bridge (where World War I started with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in 1914) and Gallery 11/07/95 which is a memorial to the Srebrenica massacre."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/kubrick-the-shining-filming-locations/","Title":"The Shining filming locations: here&#8217;s Johnny&#8230; in Oregon, California and Montana","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["North America","United States"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Horror","Legendary","Movies"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Overlook Hotel","Item2":"Interior: Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, United States\nThe exterior of the Overlook Hotel where Jack takes his son and wife to work as an off-season caretaker is the Timberline Lodge in Kubrick's The Shining.

The Great of Wall of China is an amazing hiking place but you may want to do some research beforehand to pick the most beautiful and less crowded parts like Simatai.\nThe Forbidden City (imperial palace) is another great monument you should see in Beijing.

You need to be very strategic to enjoy this wonderful experience to its fullest.\nIf you are not an experienced diver, your best option is to take a day trip on a glass-bottom boat.

Note that if you are diving you will need to wait one day before flying to the Outback/Red Centre."},{"Item1":"Day 6: Daintree Rainforest","Item2":"Whether you have dived or not to see the Great Barrier Reef, it's definitely worthwhile to go to the Daintree Rainforest, the oldest tropical rainforest on earth.\nIt is located 2 hours away from Cairns by bus (departure at 7.30 AM and return at 6.30 PM, approximately).\n                             \n                               There are various hiking trails ranging from one to six hours that will allow you to truly enjoy the beautiful and wild nature the Daintree Rainforest has to offer."},{"Item1":"Days 7-8: Uluru / Ayers Rock","Item2":"Fly from Cairns to Ayers Rock Airport early in order to have the entire day to visit Ayers Rock. Also named Uluru, Ayers Rock is a large red sandstone rock formation (see photo).

Drop off your rental car and take a direct flight to Sydney (about 3 hours).\nThese two last days of the itinerary should give you the opportunity to visit interesting sights you didn't have time to see at the beginning of the trip like, for example, Bondi Beach, located about half an hour by public transport from Sydney Town Hall.\n                             \n                               Another option if you think you have seen enough of Sydney could be  to squeeze an extra destination between Alice Springs and Sydney (how about the Kangaroo Island near Adelaide? ) but it may prove difficult so we are just leaving it as a suggestion in case you had a perfect timing so far and/or are willing to stretch your trip by one or two additional days (and nah... it's not cheating!)."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/penang-island-to-langkawi-5-day-itinerary/","Title":"From Penang Island to Langkawi: a 5-day trip in paradise – by R","SubTitle":null,"Destinations":["Asia","Southeast Asia","Malaysia"],"Duration":"5 days","Themes":["Backpacker","Nature","RoadTrip"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Days 1-2: Penang Island","Item2":"We reached Penang Island after a long night of bus, which took us from Kuala Lumpur to George Town, the capital of the State of Penang.\n5am is not a good time to arrive in George Town, let's make it clear right now! I strongly advise you to check the travel details before jumping in the first bus you see at the bus station in Kuala Lumpur...\nAnyway, we found an hotel that was pretty well-located in the city center and manage to negotiate a bit to get our room early and get some rest. We then went on a tour of the city, soon renting scooters to be able to see more locations. Here again, my advice will be to really TAKE CARE when driving. Even if you are an expert at driving motorbikes, the traffic is extremely dense in the city and it's no easy task to orientate yourself!\n                             \n                               Enough said, here are my recommendations for you:\nKek Lok Si Temple: one of the largest Buddhist temple in Southeast Asia, this temple is really impressive and you'll need at least 2 hours to do a great visit. It will give you a nice reward when reaching the top: a (truly) amazing views of Georgetown! Do NOT miss the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas...\nThe Penang Botanic Gardens is located nearby Jalan Air Terjun in George Town. Originally established in 1884, it has grown into one of the greatest botanical garden in South-East Asia. Don't miss the collections of rare plant species in: Fern House, Palm Collection, Orchidarium, Cactus House, Bromeliad and Begonia House! Follow the monkeys...\nThe view at Penang Hill... You'll get there (735 m!) using the Penang Hill Railway, a funicular railway which climbs Penang Hill from Air Itam. The view is stunning up there, don't miss it."},{"Item1":"Days 3-5: Langkawi","Item2":"Langkawi\nGoing from Penang Island to Langkawi, we used the bus and a boat. We first went north by bus to Kuala Perlis, and we then took a boat to Langkawi. Reaching Langkawi is truly sensational, as this is an archipelago that counts more than 100 islands all more beautiful than the others.\nAfter looking for a decent hostel not too far away from the beach of Kampung Lubok Buaya, we were pleased to see that they rented scooters. This gave us a lof of autonomy and made us able to visit a little more than 10 beaches in one day.\nWe also went hiking in Mount Machinchang.

Although it would be unfair to resume Bologna to its extraordinary food, it is what this city is the most famous for (have you heard of the bolognese sauce, actually referred to as 'al ragu' in Italy?).\n                             \n                               Besides food that you should definitely take time to enjoy (how about a cooking class for lunch?), Bologna has also many interesting places to visit starting with the Basilica of Santo Stefano and Piazza Maggiore where is also located the Basilica of San Petronio."},{"Item1":"Days 7-8: Florence","Item2":"Two days is not a lot to fully enjoy Florence, especially if you are very into Renaissance but let's try to still make the best of it. Take a train from Bologna to Florence early in the morning. I see you starting to curse at this trip itinerary that don't let you sleep in the morning, but this time it will be a short ride (less than a hour).\nFlorence is quite compact so it's actually easy to see most sights within a day by walking (or by bus if you don't want to get tired). Wander around, sit at a terrasse and have a good coffee to get a first feel of the city. After that start a thorough tour and visit the places that interest you the most. \n                             \n                               The best spots in our opinion are the following:\n- Uffizi: a must-see for any Renaissance art lover; just Botticelli's paintings are worth the entry\n- Catedral Santa Maria del Fiore (Florence Cathedral): make sure to climb the Duomo for a stunning view of the city and a close look at Vasari and Federic Zuccari's fresco\n- Basilica di San Miniato al Monte for its Romanesque architecture and perfect location on top of Florence – perhaps the most underrated sight the city has to offer."},{"Item1":"Day 9: Chianti region (north of Tuscany)","Item2":"In the morning of the 9th day start the road trip part of this Italy itinerary! Pick up the rental car in Florence and drive through the Chianti region to discover the birthplace of Italy's most famous wine. Drive through the Chianti Classico subregion with Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti, Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti.\n                             \n                               Finish the day with San Gimignano, a medieval town perched on a hill that could easily summarize all Tuscany by itself.

Most of it can be seen with one day of steady walking. We advise you to visit the Museo dell’Opera Metropolitana del Duomo and Siena Cathedral. If you have enough time you could also climb the Facciatone for an amazing view of Siena, especially Piazza del Campo, Palazzo Pubblico and Torre del Mangia.\n                             \n                               In the evening enjoy a great dinner (we vouch for La Taverna di San Giuseppe) followed by a few drinks on Piazza del Campo if you're up for it!"},{"Item1":"Day 11: Val d'Orcia (south of Tuscany)","Item2":"Brace yourself for what many consider the most beautiful part of Tuscany: Val d'Orcia. The region was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2004 to preserve its breathtaking landscapes characterized by hills of the most amazing green carefully flourished by vineyards and olive trees.\nWe would recommend to follow this road itinerary:\nSiena &gt; Asciano &gt; Abbazia di Monte Oliveto Maggiore &gt; Montalcino &gt; Abbazia di Sant'Antimo &gt; Bagno Vignoni &gt; Pienza &gt; Montepulciano.\n                             \n                               This may seem like a lot of driving but it's really not that heavy. Also, you of course don't have to stop everywhere. The two abbazias (abbeys) are definitely worth the visit though. In the evening besides finding a good restaurant (which is an every day requisite in Italy!), look for an agriturismo (traditional farm) for the night. Depending on the season you may want to book it in advance. We warmly recommend Agriturismo Cerreto in Pienza."},{"Item1":"Days 12-14: Rome","Item2":"The last destination of this Italy itinerary in 2 weeks is Rome. Drop off the rental car the nearest as possible to Chiusure where you can then take a train to Rome (less than 2 hours). There are many places to see in Rome, hence it's important to have a well-thought plan and to book most of the attractions in advance.  Here's what we recommend:\nDay 12 - morning: visit the historical centre of Rome around the Pantheon. Have a coffee at Sant'Eustachio Il Caffè that the New York Times once praised to serve the best coffee in the world.\n                             \n                               Day 12 - afternoon: visit the Colosseum, the symbol of the Roman empire and its famous gladiatorial games. If you have time you may also want to check out the Palatino (Palatine Hill) and Foro Romano (Roman Forum).\nDay 13: head to the Vatican very early in the morning (before 8 AM!) to have the unique pleasure of discovering Basilica di San Pietro (St. Peter's Basilica) and climbing the Dome without hordes of tourists around, like that's often the case later in the day. After that continue with the Chapel Sistine to see one of the world's most important and extraordinary work of art, the ceiling painted by Michelangelo."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/nebraska-filming-locations-itinerary/","Title":"Nebraska Filming Locations and Itinerary","SubTitle":"From Montana to Nebraska","Destinations":["North America","United States","Montana","Nebraska","South Dakota"],"Duration":null,"Themes":["Legendary","Movies","RoadTrip"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Billings, Montana","Item2":"The first of Nebraska filming locations is Billings (Montana) where the movie starts with Woody Grant walking on the highway determined to reach Lincoln (Nebraska) to collect a $1 million sweepstakes prize.\n                             \n                               The family of Woody knows that the prize is bogus but cannot make him hear reason.

More subtly, it gives perspective and depth's to the life of Woody who on first impression didn't accomplish much.\n                             \n                               These core scenes that in the movie take place in Hawthorne and its surroundings were shot in the towns of Stanton (see image), Plainview, Norfolk and Hooper., all located in Nebraska. The second bar Woody goes to with his son after arriving in Hawthorne is the Sodbuster Saloon in Hooper (see photo of the town here)."},{"Item1":"Lincoln, Nebraska","Item2":"After sorting out all his family issues and getting closure on his past, Woody can look ahead to a peaceful future with his wife and sons but nonetheless remains stubborn enough to still want to go to Lincoln in Nebraska to complete the journey he started.\n                             \n                               Woody and his son arrives at the sweepstakes company and after a laconic \"Sorry, you didn't have a winning number\" from the employee and a cap as consolation prize, the two head back to Billings in Montana."}]},{"Link":"https://www.legendarytrips.com/trip/new-zealand-3-weeks-itinerary/","Title":"New Zealand in 3 weeks","SubTitle":"Highlights: Bay of Islands, Abel Tasman, Mt Cook, Milford Sound","Destinations":["New Zealand"],"Duration":"21 days","Themes":["Backpacker","Hiking","Nature"],"Steps":[{"Item1":"Days 1-2: Auckland (North Island)","Item2":"The first destination of this trip to New Zealand in 3 weeks is Auckland. Rest from your flight and explore the largest and most populated city of New Zealand for the first day.\n                             \n                               A few interesting attractions you may want to check out are the famous Sky Tower (tallest free-standing structure in the Southern Hemisphere), Auckland Museum (useful if you didn't have time to read about New Zealand before your trip) and the Viaduct Harbour (ideal area for dinner)."},{"Item1":"Days 3-4: Bay of Islands (North Island)","Item2":"On the second day, reach the Bay of Islands. It is located 260 km (160 mi) from Auckland (4-5 hours by bus / 40 minutes by plane). You can reach Russell by ferry from Opua if you have a car or from Paihia if you are on foot. From then on, you will enjoy a beautiful area of 144 islands with the most amazing variety of wildlife (penguins, whales, gannets, dolphins..etc.) and stunning beaches all around.\n                             \n                               There are many things to do in the Bay of Islands like fishing and hiking. For accommodation, depending on your budget you could rent a nice little 'Bach' (cottage) or camp (it's possible on the Urupukapuka Island)."},{"Item1":"Days 5-6: Rotorua (North Island)","Item2":"On the 5th day, go back to Auckland and then continue to Rotorua. You can either have a night stop in Auckland or proceed directly depending on your energy level but we would advise the latter in order to spend at least one night in Rotorua.\n                             \n                               It may also be a good idea to catch the midday show at the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute. And of course, enjoy what Rotorua is famous for: its amazing geothermal geysers and boiling mud pools."},{"Item1":"Day 7: Wellington (North Island)","Item2":"On the 7th or 8th day of this trip, take a plane from Rotorua to Wellington, the capital of Australia. Wellington is quite an interesting city where you can enjoy a variety of museums like the Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa Tongarewa) or the Museum of Wellington City &amp; Sea.\n                             \n                               The large natural harbour (70 km² / 27 mi²) of Wellington is also a must-see. If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings, you may want to take a tour around the city to explore the filming locations that were used for the famous Peter Jackson's film trilogy."},{"Item1":"Days 8-11: Nelson, Golden Bay & Abel Tasman National Park (South Island)","Item2":"Fly from Wellington to Nelson, explore briefly the city famous for its hippy markets and then take a bus to reach Abel Tasman National Park, certainly one of the most beautiful destinations of this trip to New Zealand in 3 weeks. Located on the Golden Bay, Abel Tasman National Park is the perfect combination of beaches, wildlife (watch out for flying kiwis!) and hiking trails.\n                             \n                               If you are into hiking, you can follow the 54.4 km (33.8 mi) Abel Tasman Coast Track that takes between 3 and 5 days to complete. This trip itinerary plans 3 nights for this whole Nelson - Golden Bay - Abel Tasman part but you can of course spend more or less time depending on your preference (beware though that this may impact the rest of your trip)."},{"Item1":"Days 12-14: Aoraki / Mount Cook (South Island)","Item2":"After this slice of paradise that is Abel Tasman, prepare for another one: Aoraki / Mt cook, the highest mountain in New Zealand (3,724 m /12,218 ft) with its breathtaking snowy peaks and glaciers. You can go there either by renting a car or by bus but the latter option will take longer and you will have to go through Christchurch.\n                             \n                               Mt Cook is the ideal place for advanced mountain climbing but it also offers beautiful hiking trails that can easily be completed in just one day or even less (check ou this great link for a list of short walks that take under 4 hours)."},{"Item1":"Day 15: Queenstown (South Island)","Item2":"Take another bus (or continue with the rental car if you got one) to Queenstown and its Remarkable Mountains. Explore the town and enjoy a relax evening before the last leg of this adventure.\n                             \n                               Due to time constraints we wouldn't advise to spend more than one day in Queenstown but you can of course do so if you are not opting for a long trek in Fiordland."},{"Item1":"Days 16-20: Milford Sound","Item2":"You will notice that we haven't advocated renting a car so much until now but if there's one place to do so it would be between Queenstown and Milford Sound, a fjord located in Fiordland National Park. The scenery along this 4-hour drive is just breathtaking and will make you forgive New Zealand for its left-handed driving habit (provided you're not already used to it).\n                             \n                               There are many treks available in Fiordland but we wholeheartedly recommend Milford Sound and especially the 53.5 km (33.2 mi) Milford Track and its 5 days (4 nights) of bliss in the purest and wildest nature New Zealand has to offer."},{"Item1":"Day 21: Back Auckland (flight home)","Item2":"After completing this amazing New Zealand 3-week classic itinerary and filling your head with memories that will live with you forever, it's now time to go back to Auckland for a last peek at the capital of New Zealand. And yes, now would be a good time to visit the places you hadn't time to see when you first arrived.\n                             \n                               &nbsp;"}]}]
