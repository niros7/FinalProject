Four years back, we chanced upon images of the Prabalgad Fort in Panvel, Maharashtra, literally 2 hours away from Lokhandwala, where we were for some work.We decided to go for it, since it was almost an arm&apos;s away. We booked a room near our trek spot and spent the night there, and 8am started our trek of 3 hours, to reach about 2,300 feet up.A very safe trek, even those who aren&apos;t used to trekking will enjoy it, as it is a little steep and not too much and the views on the way and upon reaching the Kalavantin fort are amazing. The landscape makes you feel very surreal. I have done other easy treks around India, but this one definitely takes the cake.My brother and I decided to document our trek with a slightly fictional touch to the whole thing, also delivering the message, that you can travel to escape certain situations in your life, but your emotions will always catch up with you, no matter where you are.Prabalgad Fort PeakHotelsMaphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B_UK2Pahzk",

However, even if you have money and family support, there are still few factors that substantially limit your capability to travel solo. You may call them internal factors, mental barriers or psychological limitations; but, the good news is that you can get over those factors as they are under your own control.So, here I am listing 7 mental barriers women need to overcome in order to achieve their solo travel goals.Mental Barrier No. 1 &#x2013; FearAs Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, says in Lean In &#x2013; Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,&#x201C;Fear is the root of so many of the barriers that women face. Fear of not being liked. Fear of making the wrong choice. Fear of drawing negative attention. Fear of overreaching. Fear of being judged. Fear of failure. And the holy trinity of fear: the fear of being a bad mother/wife/daughter.&#x201D; (To know more about the Lean In book and the Lean In organisation, check out their official website.)And she is spot on! One of the strongest internal mental barriers women face is fear. And how do we get over it? By facing them head on!Always remember, fortune favors the brave. So, find out why are you scared of solo traveling, and then DO IT SCARED; or, ask yourself: what would I do if I weren&#x2019;t scared? And then go do it.Mental Barrier No. 2 &#x2013; Self-doubt and lack of confidenceImposter Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon. It is a pervasive feeling of self-doubt, insecurity, or fraudulence, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. You think yourself to be a fake or a fraud, despite your achievements. You think that you have succeeded because of luck, and not because of your hard work, talent, skills or qualifications.Although Imposter Syndrome affects all kinds of people, several studies have shown that women are more susceptible to it.It is because of this phenomenon that women consistently underestimate themselves. Even highly skilled, smart, and intelligent women doubt and highly underestimate their ability to successfully travel alone for longer duration.The best way out of this problem is to realize that &#x201C;feeling like a fraud&#x201D; is normal. You only have to remind yourself of what you&#x2019;ve accomplished. Believe in your abilities. Trust me, women are far stronger than they think themselves to be!Mental Barrier No. 3 &#x2013; Low ambition and lower expectationsOf course, there are many women who are as ambitious as any other man; still, in general, the majority of women are less ambitious as compared to men. Younger women are ambitious; but with age and increased family responsibilities, they tend to give up their ambition, including career and travel goals.Being ambitious is not a compliment for women; on the other hand, men have to be ambitious. Women who show power, ambition and the will to pursue her passion often pay social penalty. And this becomes one of the mental barriers as women lower their expectation of what they can or should achieve.So, be ambitious and have courage to pursue your ambition, come what may! If you want to travel alone, then do it! Don&#x2019;t let anyone tell you that you can&#x2019;t do it.But, let me make myself clear, by no means I intend to say that women who choose to stay at home and take care of their family are less ambitious than working women; as long as the decision of staying at home is based on personal choice, and not based on any pressure from her partner, family or society, it should be respected!Mental Barrier No. 4 &#x2013; Internalization of negative messagesOur cultural conditioning associate many negative messages with a female solo traveler. For instance, messages like &#x2013; it is wrong for a female to travel alone; a girl traveling alone is like an open safe (remember this dialogue from Jab We Met movie); girls from good family do not go out alone; girls who travel alone are rebels and not family oriented; solo travelers are inherently sad.Most of the women internalize these negative messages and stop thinking about traveling alone; they do not want to be the odd-one-out or break stereotype.The only way to get over the mental barriers like these is to realize that there is nothing wrong in traveling alone. Solo travel is not gender specific activity; it is a choice and that choice is available to both men and women.So, stop internalizing such negative messages and do what you truly desire!Mental Barrier No. 5 &#x2013; Desire to be liked by everyoneOur cultural ideology has always associated men with the role of the protector, and women with nurturing role. Anything that goes beyond that nurturing role for a woman creates a negative impact and makes everyone uncomfortable.People consider women, who can travel alone, as &#x201C;too independent.&#x201D; Such women generally don&#x2019;t rely on any other person for their financial or emotional needs. People see such independence as being against the basic norms of society (as men claim superiority over women on the basis of dependability).Several studies proved that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. So, women who become &#x201C;too independent&#x201D; and can travel on their own, are not liked by everyone.In their desire to be liked by everyone, women compromise their goals, including travel goals; generally, it is women who hold themselves back to give way to the wishes of the family members and society.To overcome this mental barrier, women need to understand that one cannot make everyone happy; you will always disappoint few people. But always remember: You are living your life, not theirs. So stop trying to be liked by everyone.Mental Barrier No. 6 &#x2013; Feeling guiltyNumber of researches have proved that women are more prone to feel guilty as they have more interpersonal sensitivity.When women stay at home and take care of children and aging parents, they feel guilty for not supporting their husband financially; when women enter workforce, they feel guilty for not spending more time with their families; and when women spend more time at home, they feel guilty of not performing well at professional front.And while juggling with all these stereotyped roles, women feel guilty for going on a solo trip.A lot of this guilt originates from the way we have conditioned women for thousands of years into gender stereotypes. Women have to get along with others, not hurt anybody&#x2019;s feelings, and take care of loved ones; solo travel is mostly contrary to these standards.In order to overcome the feeling of guilt for traveling alone, women need to realize that it is okay to take care of yourself. Unless you take care of yourself first, both physically and mentally, you won&#x2019;t be able to take care of others. In long run, there are more chances of your suppressed feelings turning to feeling of resentment.Mental Barrier No. 7 &#x2013; &#x201C;What others will think!&#x201D;For a long time now, society has recognized women as keepers of family values and reputation. And since we live in a close-knit society, what our family members think, and what society thinks, govern our actions.This emotional and societal baggage often determines the course of action taken by women. So, when it comes to decide whether to travel alone, &#x201C;what others will think&#x201D; is a huge consideration for women. This mentality has crushed so many dreams.The only way of getting over this barrier is to understand that opinion of other people (except people who really matter to you) is none of your concern.Overcoming these internal or mental barriers is the first and the most important aspect of solo travel. You can manage every external barrier with the support of your partner and your family; but first, kill your own demons!In case you want to travel alone, but don&#x2019;t know if you are ready for it, do check out How to prepare yourself for solo travel.

What other mental or psychological barriers restrict you? Let me know in the comments section below.",

And, thus happened Chikamagalur at a happy occasion of 10th Anniversary with my beau and a group of friends.Date: 14th to 16th July 2018Company: 2 couples, including 1 with a kid, mostly non vegetarianWeather: Heavy rains with bouts of clear weather. Though not the best time to visit due to heavy rains but still a good time to enjoy nature.Approx travel time: 6 hours from Bangalore to Chikamagalur town and another 45 minutes to reach the stay.About the Place: This is the place where Sufi mystic Baba Budan,smuggled and initiated the coffee plantation culture from Yemen. Chikamagalur hills have nurtured the coffee culture and have become a slice of heaven on a permanent coffee high.What to carry: Woolen clothing, rainwear, umbrella, rubber shoes/ shoes to prevent from leach bites (which is very common)The Itinerary: We left from Bangalore, Residency road at 11 AM and took over an hour to cross the heavy traffic. With a small stopover at Nayan Tare restaurant which offered good food, we hit Chikamagalur town around 5 PM. The drive uptill now was smooth and about to become more scenic, as we moved up the winding roads of coffee plantations, with jackfruits hanging beautifully. The roads are narrow covered by big rocks on the way. The long trees dancing beautifully with the wind are a treat to eyes and ears. Though it was hard to step out due to intermittent rains but drive was pleasurable. We finally reached our destination around 6 and shown our rooms, which were rustic huts with all facilities. Evening followed with world cup football match and good snacks. We spent rest of the evening around bonfire and good company. A good stroll in the morning was a delight with lots of singing birds and a walk through the plantation. A laid back and lengthy breakfast followed by some indoor sports and a small nap post lunch, made up for all the work induced tiredness. As the options to step out were limited due to heavy rains, we opted for a mini jungle safari at Bhadra Tiger Reserve, which turned out to be average due to weather and smaller time window. We ended up sighting Deers and wild boars and no tigers, elephants, beers. But nonetheless saw a 150 years old tree, deep in the forest. Evening was relaxed yet brimming with enthusiasm due to Football World cup finals. After a good deep sleep and heavy breakfast, we started our return at 12 and ended up reaching Bangalore at 6:30 PM.About the Stay: This was my first full fledged homestay and I wasn&#x2019;t disappointed in any way. We opted for the Coffee Bean Homestay, post recommendation from it&#x2019;s sister concern- where we dint get any bookings. This one is located at the far end of Chikamagalur engulfed with Coffee &amp; Pepper plantations. The stay is very scenic with abundant trees, all blossoming in varied colors. You are amidst nature and in the viewing distance of a waterfall. Seeing pets and animals in close proximity was an add on (they had multiple varieties of dogs, cats, cows, fishes, hens), along with a nursery and plantation. This pleasantly meant that dairy and poultry products were in house and woah, what quality!! Vegetarian food was good and some home made stuff like marmalade and pickles were super. We got to experience 2 types of stay, one in a normal room and other in a cottage- both good in their respects. Its a huge property with lots of indoor games, common TV viewing facility, bonfire and on top of it - welcoming hosts. Some wooden artefacts are primitive and very good. A good place to just go and stay over for a sleepacation, you will come back rested. Room rent per night including food/snacks goes upto 6000 INR. Highly recommended because of locals and very good service.Warnings: Coffee plantations are prone to leaches, who thrive on one&#x2019;s dirty blood. Once bitten the leach will stick to the skin and needs to be thrown out. Liquor or turmeric always does the trick, but nothing to worry.Places Recommended to visit: While we were unable to explore due to weather, these are based on recommendations by locals. One can hire jeep as these places are not accessible via personal vehicle:&#x2022;\tMullayangiri: Highest peak, 6400 ft above sea level and is very windy (one needs to hire a jeep)&#x2022;\tKudremukh National Park&#x2022;\tBhadra Tiger Reserve for Wildlife sightings, including Tigers (Muthodi Forest Reserve)&#x2022;\tHebbe WaterfallsWhat to go back with: Coffee, Pepper, jackfruit, coffee stem furniture and loads of happy memories.",

		"Text": "BangaloreHotelsMapBefore visiting, I never knew such thing existed &quot;A Brain museum&quot;. That too in the same city where I live and it&apos;s awful for me to call myself a traveller at heart when I have not fully explored the city I live in. So as soon as I got to know about the Brain Museum, I booked the appointed for the coming Saturday to visit The Neuropathology Brain Museum (Human Brain Museum) Bangalore.&#xA0;That Saturday morning I got up early had breakfast and reached Nimhans Neurobiology Research Centre 30 minutes before the mentioned time. I was asked to wait as it is a guided tour, we need to wait for everyone to join before starting the tour. So I was waiting at reception and reading the posters about the Rules and regulations. The time when I visited, photography was banned inside the museum, it uses to be allowed earlier but seems people were more interested in taking photographs and making a video then concentrating in introduction tour, So the authorities were forced to ban the photography inside museum. So finally at 10:30 the tour started, there were only 3 people that day for the tour. We were guided to a hall full of brain specimens. There were collection of brains from victims of Road Traffic Accidents, cases of schizophrenia, stroke, brain mass lesion, HIV, and TBM, Brain damaged by bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Along with humans, there were brain sample of many animals too. Not only the brains, there were specimens of remarkable lungs, and lungs damaged by pollution. It is so fascinating to see how a fetus grows within a few weeks. And at the end, they have a surprise for everyone. The guide took out the surprise from the table hidden under the cloth. It was a specimen of real human brain, heart, and kidney there was even a slice of liver too. The guide explained the details about each and gave every visitor a chance to touch and hold them if they wish. This is something unique if you are not a medical student.The Museum tour not only introduce us to the world of&#xA0;Neurobiology but also clears out the myths and increase the awareness about human body. They teach the public and make them aware about cadaver organ donation and brain donation.The Museum is one of its kind and should not be missed. It is open only on Wednesday and Saturday and there is no entry fee. I will suggest booking a prior appointment because there is a limit to the number of people in each guided tour.By the end of the tour apart from all the lessons and awareness I got to know the brain doesn&apos;t have pain receptors, So whenever you get a head ache, its not the brain that hurts, because brain cannot feel pain. So if you really want to know why people get headaches then you need to visit the&#xA0;Neuropathology Brain Museum (Human Brain Museum) Bangalore.",

I had a wonderful four days stay in Hotel Mercure, LA Defense, Paris in which i not only got to see all the major tourist destinations, but also got quiet an insight into the life here.Beige color Buildings dorne the most of the city&apos;s landscape, not to forget the huge french windows in each gallery beautifully decorated with bright roses. The City is mostly built in a circular shape with n number of lanes leading you to the modern world&apos;s masterpiece and a world heritage Effile Tower. Do you remember that scene in the movie Queen when poor Kangana is unable to get away from Effile, well it is so true, and you have to see to believe it. Its beyond words. There is just one high rise building in the vicinity of the tower, which blocks the view of it for a particular area of people, and guess what they are said to hate the building.Wherever you are, may it be your hotel room, on some random road, or even on boat cruise around Seine river, the view of the tower seems to never leave your side. And unless some one like Kangana has not broken your heart you would always love to see it.In the past few years i have visited Turkey, Greece, Spain And France and my vote for the best overall experience goes to France. I met a lot of locals here, and each one of them was so kind and helpful. Even when they could not understand English, they would find someone around and that person would act as a mediocre. Most of the time we needed help for navigation and train schedules, and we certainly got whatever help we needed. Due to globalization, and offcourse because Paris is a big tourist destination you would find a mix culture here. I think People from almost all continents are living there, making it real global community.So, when i came back from my visit, i not only got these souvenirs and Parisian chocolates but also lots of love from Parisian people, and with a hope that I would soon return to the beautiful Parisian lanes looking for Effile Tower.",

		"Text": "Day 1On this day I started from Srinagar at 4 in the morning. It was strike in Srinagar on this day, so this was the only vehicle available and that too till Kargil only. On my way to Kargil, I passed the famous Drass.( one of the coldest inhabitant village). Also I crossed the mighty Zojilla Pass.I reached Kargil at 10 and I was damn hungry. Hungry and seeing delicious momos forced me to step into a small Cafe who served real watery and delicious momos. Finally at 5pm I reached Leh. I asked my brother who earlier went to Leh as were to stay in Leh, he suggested me the changspa road. So I directly went there and guess what? There were more foreigners than the local people. So after searching for many guest houses I went to a guest house and booked it for a night. The guest houses there are not really expensive. And in that area you can find many good cafes where you can spend your evening with quality food. Day 2This day I woke up a little late because I was damn tired. So I thought of spending the day seeing local places. I went to a German Cafe and had breakfast there. Its on the same Changspa road. I was roaming on the road and seeing a bike rental shop, I don&apos;t know what clicked my mind and straight way went there and asked them for a rented bike. After all the formalities I rented the bike, filled the fuel tank and left for nubra valley. Its is one of the famous valley of famous valleys of ladakh region and a tourist attraction as well. Also in between you would pass through the famous-the mighty Khardungla Pass( highest inhabitan motorable all weather road-18380 ft). I left from leh at 2.30pm and the road to nubra valley is quite smooth except some 14 kms ( Khardungla Patch). But ensure that you fill your Petrol tank fully because you won&apos;t find any fuel station till Diskit which is 120 kms from Leh. In between I found many bikers as well and I joined 3 bikers namely Pradeep, Gaurav and Akram from Hyderabad, Dehradun and Bangalore respectively. We reached Hunder(a place in nubra valley) at 10pm. Without doing anything we searched for an accommodation to crash in for the night. There you can find many camping tent guest houses with great setup and surrounding and at reasonable rates( you need to bargain as well). We parked our bikes and went inside the tents, every tent is the same with a proper double bed and a washroom. It was quite clean and after getting fresh we went in the lawn and had dinner. One problem is there in Hunder that the lights are turned off everywhere at 11pm. So after dinner we didn&apos;t have any time and we were tired as well. So finally we were off to sleep. Day 3We woke up at 8 in the morning and after having a good breakfast we went to take the famous camel ride in sand dunes( double necked camel) and after that went to the famous Diskit monastery. The Monastery is quite big with around 150-200 stairs. There arr two parts of the monastery and&#xA0; are located at different sides after entering through the main gate. The view from the monastery is quite scintillating. We wanted to go to the pangong lake through nubra valley because it is the short cut route and it would save one day of our trip. Otherwise we had to go back to Leh and from there to pangong lake. But the road from nubra to pangong is quite tricky and dangerous but adventurous as well. So we gave more preference to adventure and went ahead to pangong lake and this turned out to br my one of the bravest and adventurous decisions. The road is full of water fall crossings and water with height of more than 2-3 feet and with a great flow. My shoes were full filled with water and clothes were all wet. Cigarettes and tea in between kept me alive. This road is fucking dangerous and if you are good in biking only then choose this road. We reached pangong at 11pm and there also we stayed in camping tents besides the lake only. The view of the lake from the tent at night is something that one shouldn&apos;t miss. We were as usual tired and were off to sleep without even having dinner. Day 4After waking up we straight way went to the famous Pangong Lake. The lake is very very beautiful with Crystal clear blue water. Don&apos;t try to taste the water as it is very salty. This is&#xA0; the lake were the shooting of the famous bollywood movie 3 idiots took place. Their you can see the things that were in the movie like the 3 ass seat, the scooty and the famous kissing spot. The tourists keep themselves busy in clicking&#xA0; photographs&#xA0; using these things. After the sight seeing, the other people decided to go to the Tsomoriri lake. I didn&apos;t go there because of two reasons :1. Its the same as Pangong( pangong being better)2. You will miss the famous Changla Pass. So again I was solo, traveling back to Leh. During the way you will cross the famous Changla pass( this is the second highest pass-17688 ft ). I reached Leh at 6pm and again stayed in a guest house at Changspa road. After putting my bags in the guest house, I went to the Leh main market and had some tasty momos. I window shopped at almost each shop. And then I went to babylon cafe, they have a nice rooftop set up and ordered some food and had dinner there. Day 5I was continously riding for 4 days, so I decided to take a break. This day I kept for the local sight seeing. I woke up quite late and then after having some food, I went to the famous Leh palace. It is a seven story ancient building with a temple inside. Then I went to Hall Of Fame. It an army center in which there is a museum where the pictures of our brave soldiers are kept along their contribution written. Also there you can see the weapons conquered by our army during wars. The detailed description of the famous Kargil War is written there. We should go there to see the contribution of our army towards the people and the society. After that I again went to the market and brought some candies for home. The Ladakhi candies are very famous and quite tasty as well. Being a hard core non vegetarian, I couldn&apos;t resist the mutton barbecues( a shack run by a kashmiri). So. I asked him to make a couple of them. The barbecues were more than yummy, so I asked him to make a couple more. It was getting late, so I decided to call the day off and went to my room. Day 6Initially my trip was upto Ladakh only but I decided to extended it to Manali because I wanted to cover all the famous passes. And I am super glad that I extended it. The road from Leh to Manali is one of the most beautiful but one of the dangerous as well. Its between mountains and you can to cover as many as 5 dangerous waterfall crossings and as many as 7-8 small water crossings. The big one&apos;s are very dangerous and life threatening as well. Death will play hide and seek with you on this road. There were many instances where I thought that I should return back but somehow my will power helped me to cross those obstacles. Also you will cross the famous Tanglangla Pass( 17582 ft) and the Gata loops( a road of 71 hairpin loops). I started my journey at 7am from Leh and at 10 pm I reached Keylong( a village in between). So I decided to stay there for the night. Also on this route, you should carry fuel with you because for 365 kms you won&apos;t find any filling station. Day 7I started my journey at 9am and reached manali at 5pm. This route is again quite dangerous. On this way you have to pass the famous Rohtang Pass(13058 ft). The road from Rohtag to Manali is very very dangerous. You will find zero visibility with cloudy weather, fog and skiddy roads. But the view is breathtaking and beautiful. On this route as well you will cross many waterfalls.",

		"Text": "Hey Guys ! Continuing from where we left in the last Paris blog (https://www.tripoto.com/trip/paris-among-the-most-loved-tourist-city-for-a-reason-europe-travel-series-blog-1-5b6c4cd10c9f4) , here&#x2019;s the next write up of Euro Travel series :\nBelgiumHotelsMapHaving spent a happy 40 hours or so at Paris , we left for our next destination &#x2013; Brussels, Belgium , in our very own Mercedes Benz &#x2013; The Tour Bus I mean :PWell the best part about Europe Travel is that you are on a continuous sight-seeing spree even while in transit. Wherever you look, 10 out of 10 times you gonna be spellbound by the sheer abundance of natural aura all around. Lush Green Farms , Windmills , Clouds etc. together present a live painting of a beautiful landscape .Icing on our cake during travel were our Ready-To-Eat Indian stuff including Nut Crackers , Cupa Noodles , Aalu Bhujia&#x2019;s &amp; other hunger arresters which we used to munch down during short stops at Gas Stations.Mini-EuropeHotelsMapAfter being driven for about 3.5 hours, we reached Mini-Europe which is a must &#x2013; visit spot in Brussels and rightly so . Well it&#x2019;s a beautifully crafted &amp; well thought of tourist attraction which houses the proto-types of all major European Attractions. Continuing with the theme of #Minimum Text &amp; #Maximum Photographs for Euro Travel series, I would rather let following photographs do the talking about what Mini -Europe :Grand PlaceHotelsMapWith wide smiles , we left Mini &#x2013; Europe for Brussels Main City area . Just as you enter the Brussels city , a feeling of deja vu strikes you, thanks to yet another spectacular display of architecture &amp; civil engineering marvels , which seem similar to the one at Paris.However, one close look and you find that aesthetics here are little different from the traditional Gothic architecture of France.Manneken PisHotelsMapBut how do you know that you are at Brussels ? May sound funny to some , but a peeing boy statue at every nook &amp; corner of the streets, the Manneken Pis ,will help you confirm your location. It&#x2019;s kind of a Statue with National Importance here . (original one is a Bronze Statue)While there are many stories regarding the same but most popular one is that a very rich &amp; influential man of Brussels lost his son . Everyone went frenzy to search for him. And when he was finally found , at that very moment , he was actually peeing and hence the over loving Dad got a statue erected in the same pose.And then you have a this guy , a single rub on whose hand is supposed to bring you luck , while it&#x2019;s a separate issue that he himself seems to be one who needs maximum luck. :)Just as tourists admire Cafe&#x2019;s &amp; Bistros of Paris (especially the one along Champ Elysees), Belgium&#x2019;s chocolates are no less sought after. We tasted lot&#x2019;s of different chocolates before settling for ever so popular Godiva .Brussels Waffles are not to be missed either :Just as the dusk knocked and we were walking back to the group meeting point , we came across this &#x201C;Incredible India &#x201D; Boutique which obviously gave us all a homely warmth .A very fulfilling but tiring day finally ended in an equally aesthetic &amp; comfortable room.As we had to leave for Germany early next morning , so we straightaway dozed off.Radisson Blu HotelHotelsMapTravel Fact : There are no borders and hence no immigration checks as such when you travel in &amp; out of countries under Schengen Visa (France , Belgium,Germany &amp; Switzerland in our case).You can simply drive through &amp; just a sign board across the road will tell you that you have crossed into another European country.Just that , for entering Switzerland , your cab/coach driver needs to complete some paper work##I hope you all enjoyed Belgium blues . Please do share / Reblog the post on your social media handles if you found it worth a read .Would really love to hear your feedback .&#xA0;Namaste &amp; Take care !!You can also reach me at :https://insideoutwithrahulyuvi.com/https://www.facebook.com/Passport.Souls/https://twitter.com/rahul_nitk81204or watch my latest EuroTrip videos here :https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN3swgm0VhdADMWGewSsKJA",

Bus - If you love road trips and landscapes but don&apos;t wanna drive, then one can catch a bus from Esplanade, Kolkata to Bishnupur. It&apos;s a 5 hour journey filled with a lot of beautiful landscapes and good roadside stalls.2. Train - If you love traveling by railway, then one can catch a train from Howrah railway station to Bishnupur. It&apos;s a 3 hour journey from Howrah to Bishnupur.3. By Road - Traveling by road is the best option. The roads are very smooth, the view is amazing and the roadside stalls and food junctions are also very reasonable. The view is so appealing that you will be compelled to stop multiple times on the way to click pictures.Exploring the cityBishnupur is a very small city with a variety of options for staying. All the temples are near to each other and so one can travel around the city on foot or hire an auto-rickshaw for Rs.300 - Rs.500 a day and explore the whole of Bishnupur.I would suggest you start early morning with visiting the Susunia hills which is famous for its holy spring, flora and its mountain faces mark the start to the journey of many mountaineers. The place is also known for its breathtaking views during the sunrise and sunset as the rays of the sun fall and go away from the mountains.Once you are done exploring the mountains and have seen the sunrise, now the real exploration starts, the pride of Bishnupur i.e. Terracotta temples. Since, all the temples are near to each other so it is up to you from where you would like to begin. The terracotta temples and the works on the walls of these temples depict India&apos;s rich heritage and culture.Madan Mohan TempleRadha Madhab TempleRasmanchaDouble Stoned ChariotAfter a surplus of rich Indian culture and heritage, now it is the time to get your hands on some of these, there are nice street markets that sell terracotta products like the very famous terracotta horse (Bankura Horse), terracotta jewellery and many other things all made of terracotta. The prices are reasonable but you can also try your luck at bargaining.Terracotta JewelleryFinally, the best ending to this trip would be ending it from where it began, yes the Susunia hills. After, a day full of travel return back to the hills with soft breeze touching your face and taking all your pain away. During the sunset time, the place feels like heaven, with the soft breeze touching your face and feet and giving you a lightweight feeling, the sun&apos;s rays falling on your face and the nearby greenery and making the place around you look like heaven. As, the sun goes down the horizon just relax, feeling the soft breeze and recollecting the pieces of Indian heritage you got to see throughout the day and I assure you that you will fall in love with the place.Keep commenting in the comments below until the next adventure.

		"Text": "HaridwarHotelsMap&quot;Survanshi king Dilip&#x2019;s son Bhagirath was performing a very harsh penance in the Himalayas to liberate his ancestors from his sins who were burned to ashes in Sage Kapil&apos;s Ashram because of his curse. In order to liberate someone&apos;s spirits your ashes must be thrown in a holy river and Bhagirath was praying Mother Ganga to come to earth and liberate them from their sins. &quot;Indian history dates back over 5000 BC as per the vedas and Puranas which can&apos;t be called myth because the mentioned are still out there and one of them is mighty Ganga. I always had interest in our history and religious texts and this time i decided to do an spiritual trek with all the stories in my mind. I reached Haridwar at mornig 8 AM from Delhi by bus. whole plan was on my mind and i had decided to reach Gangotri the same day , so without wasting time i headed straight to Rishikesh and got down at the place where i had to get the next vehicle for Uttarkashi. After confirming a taxi which was only one going that time i got freshened up a little and left for Uttarkashi. By the time we left it was 10 AM already and i started feeling nervous about reaching Gangotri the same day as it was getting late.Day 2UttarkashiHotelsMapI was right as, because of some landslides and other issues i got late and reached uttarkashi by 4 PM.UttarkashiFrom Rishikesh , Uttarkashi is 200 Kms but the route makes it even lengthier. Last taxi leaves for Gangotri at 3PM as the route from Uttarkashi onward is quite dangerous and its a journey of 100Kms which takes more than 4 hours. So i had to stay overnight at Uttarkashi . I rented a room in a hotel near taxi stand only for 300Rs as it was off season and not many tourists were there. I visited the kashi Vishwanath temple and strolled around the city enjoying some local street foods and fruits.Next day i woke up early and got ready to get the taxi by 5AM though they left by 10 AM because the taxi guys kept waiting for the passengers . So its better to take the 7am bus from Uttarkashi to Gangotri. I crossed the beautiful village of Harshil on the way which was like right out of a fantasy movie.Day 3GangotriHotelsMapBy 3PM i reached Gangotri and enquired for a stay nearby the main temple.GangotriAfter confirming and getting fresh i went to the Gangotri temple and took the blessings of Mother Ganga and surprisingly there was a &quot;Langar&quot; where the temple authorities were serving food to everyone and there were lot of armymen eating in the temple. I was hungry anyways and noone leaves the changes of getting such blessing. I fed my stomach and felt the relaxation and happiness of my stomach with that tasty and pure food. After all this i still had lot of time so i decided to explore Gangotri. So i took out my camera and started covering the places one by one on my foot.the holy town of Gangotri and river BhagirathiGangotri Temple&quot; With such a hard penance Maa Ganga the daughter of heaven got ready to come on earth but asked Bhagirath, if i will come to earth who will stop my flow which can wipe out whole planet and i end up in Patal lok. Confused Bhagirath asked Ganga whom it can be on which she replied its only Lord Shiva who can do this. Hearing this Bhagirath started praying the Mahakal and its not tough to make the Bholenath ready if you worship truely. Lord Shiva kept starring at the sky and as Ganga flows in form of river from the heaven to earth it fell directly on the Jatas of Lord making the flow of Ganga proper to land on Earth. Ganga then flown through the Sage Kapils ashram engulfing the remains of the ashes of Bhagirath&apos;s ancestors liberating them from their sins&quot;.That is why Ganga is also known as &quot;Bhagirathi&quot; near Gangotri.At GangotriAt GangotriThe holy town of GangotriAt GangotriGaurikund and Surajkund are seperated by 500 metres and the view looks thrilling if you see in evening when the flow of water is highestSurajKund at GangotriGauri Kund of GangotriMaharshi Valmiki temple at GangotriAt GangotriPandava Gufa or the Pandava cave of Gangotri is the places were it is said that Pandavas stayed while they were on the way to Kailash.

Where Pandavas stayed in their exile.Other view Of Padava caveAll the places to explore are nearby and one can easily cover the places in a day. After visiting all the places i went to take permission for Gomukh from Gangotri Forest office. By the time all the things were done it was late and i was tired. I attended the Arti at the temple and after having a nice dinner by Pratap Ji the owner of hotel and restaurant said good bye for the day...Evening Aarti at Gangotri TempleHow to reach Gangotri? Only one bus from Haridwar at morning . Take shared taxi from Rishikesh to Uttarkashi(200 Kms, 300 Rs). Then take a shared taxi from Uttarkashi to Gangotri(100 kms, 200 Rs). Leave very early if you want to cover in same day or you have to stay in Uttarkashi.Where to stay ?

		"Text": "It was till Tuesday, just 2 days before my sister&apos;s birthday, we were in dilemma to execute our plan of going solely without any of our men with us. Actually it was all a three girls tour plan...Already we were not firm with our trip, another thing that came as a barrier was the bus ticket booking and hotel booking. It was seemingly like the trip was not meant for us but my sweet husband that day itself, thinking of our happiness, booked bus tickets and a good decent hotel room for us through online booking service. So, by the night we got all geared up and packed for our trip scheduled for next day morning.\nNow, on Wednesday morning our journey started from the KSRTC bus stand at around 10:00 AM. The Bangalore highway route was already known to me as I had already commuted many through there to Bangalore. And &apos;Coorg&apos; locally called as &apos;Madikeri&apos; that comes under Kodagu district lies in between Mangalore and Bangalore. So, our journey became comfortable and super fun altogether. The sight seeing through the bus was very attracting and inviting and as we were almost reaching there, the excitement levels raised more and more.\nNow, after a 3 n 1/2 hours journey we finally reached Madikeri at around 01:30 PM. All we wanted is to reach our hotel room first and easily we could reach our destination &apos; Hotel Vasathi&apos; at Block No.11, Industrial Area, Near Pathrika Bhavan, Madikeri. Actually, we called the reception number - 094830 94614 which was sent to my phone while online booking and asked for directions, so got the place easily. After taking a 2 hours rest and finishing lunch in our hotel room, we booked a cab for 1st day sight seeing from the hotel reception for Rs. 630/- for four spots. The price was reasonable as the four spots were around the city limits. The places included the great Abbey falls, Madikeri fort and museum, Raja&apos;s tomb and Raja&apos;s seat. Actually, the ancient Omkareshwar temple was also in the list but because of heavy rains, tourist visit was blocked for that day as the lake inside the temple was over flowing. So, we planned to visit that on next day. We could finish our sight seeing easily by 06:30 PM. We took 1 hour rest and again got decked up to explore the city market and having our dinner in a good restaurant outside. Well, my daughter is a big chocolate lover and to her delight there were chocolates all over in the market like she got in Ooty. The chocolates are quite famous there, named as Coorg chocolates which you may find in other shops outside Coorg also. The next must buy is the Coorg coffee that has an amazing taste and aroma.\nWe went to Spicy treat India, a non-vegetarian restaurant, located opposite to Monappa motors. We had chicken soup, fish chilly and fish fingers. All tasted good as were recommended in online reviews. Other good eateries to try out are Abeo&apos;s Kitchen in School road and Taste of Coorg at CMC building. We finished our food and went back to our hotel. There we took lots of selfies and pictures and by 10:30 PM we slept as our next day journey was scheduled for 09:00 AM sharp.\nSo, our next day started with a stomach filling South-Indian breakfast at the hotel restaurant that included lip-smacking masala dose, vada, idli and sambar . Then we moved to our cab that we were required to book a day before itself for Rs. 1300/- for 3 spots. The charges were double than previous as the 2 spots were around 30 to 36 kilometres away from Madikeri city centre. First we finished with the Omkareshwar Temple then we headed towards visiting Kaveri Nisarga Dhama Forest Park and Namdroling Monestry { A Tibetian settlement in Karnataka and a must visit place}. The route to the places also gets through by &apos;Chikliholey&apos; reservoir and forest reserve. As, the spot was not in our itinerary, we made ourselves happy with the stories told by our driver about the reserve forest area. He also told the reserve area specializes in elephant protection and is linked to the Dubbare forest reserve. We could finish our tour by 01:30 PM and reached exactly after 1 and 1/2 hours, at around 03:00PM to Madikeri. There we had our last afternoon meal of the trip at Udupi the veg restaurant near KSRTC bus stand. We ordered a North - Indian thali, a veg dum biryani and a vanilla milk shake. The food was so delicious and satisfying that we were planning to order again but as we were in a rush to catch our buses, we could not do it. Then we reached the bus stand and caught our respective buses to Mangalore and Bangalore. I am still not satisfied with my trip as we could not visit the Dubbare elephant camp, Mandalpatti trek and Thalacauvery. Also, being a travel enthusiast I never settle for once.\nNote: The best season for visiting Coorg is around rainy season to winter season. That is the best time to embrace the beauty of waterfalls surrounding the place.\nDisclaimer: The description of places and thoughts in the article is solely travel experience of the author and has nothing to do with any particular website.\nI am an enthusiastic traveller, food lover and like to help out people when they need suggestions regarding correct eating and diet habits... I want to excel in writing too...Nothing much is there in my kitty, all what makes me is there... View all posts by f608774278 \nPublished",

I have been travelling since august 2017 to different places, be it mountains, desert, beaches etc. As you can guess from the title of this blog, its about my journey how I became a traveler, what made me to travel !!. So, let me tell you my story.&quot;Life is all about phase changes&quot;.Sometimes life will be moving very smoothly but at a times situation becomes too difficult or you can say &quot;Worse&quot; to handle. It has been about a year now that one of the most wonderful phase of my life ended. This incident not only made my life an &quot;Empty bucket&quot; filled with pain but also shattered the inner of me. The only thing I learnt at that time was to walk where the life wants you to make walk. I was standing no where in my life, completed my college, didn&apos;t got placed, and the sleepless nights that haunts me like hell. But I had support from my family ( friends and parents ) who stood beside me and gave lots of support. They were with me I needed them the most.After completing my engineering from chennai, I returned back to New delhi. Things during last days in chennai didn&apos;t went good with either in prospect of getting job or with relationship. So, I decided to return back to delhi leaving all the &quot;bad&quot; memories then and there and apply for jobs in delhi-NCR. I learnt at that time that life is filled with full of surprises and changes, and if we want to grow/move in your life, we should accept these changes and move ahead in life hoping things to get good with time.I always wanted to travel as much as I can. I got frustrated with failures in interviews. So, after giving a few interviews, finally got selected. One of the biggest tension was gone away.Just before joining the company, I decided to go for a bagpacking Trip for a few Days. This was going to be my first trip to himachal pradesh. I have never been to mountains of north india before that. I have never feel the beauty, serenity, weather of mountains.After discussing a lot over the destination to go, We decided to go dalhousie which is also called as &quot;Mini Swiss of India&quot;. Its around 600 Kms from delhi. It was around 12 Hours drive to dalhousie.We had booked a guest house at Rock Garden ( A famous place in dalhousie) which was 10-15 KMs from the dalhousie city center. What else you want on a trip? - A beautiful destination, your stay away from the city&apos;s crowd.After reaching the guest house, I opened the balcony and saw a beautiful view. I was feeling myself at the heaven standing in the balcony seeing the dhauladhar ranges, clouds and the blue sky. I just wanted to get laid under the clouds. I have never witnessed such beauty throughout my life.As we were tired after a long 14 hours drive, We decided to take rest for a few hours and go for a drive till &quot;chamera Dam&quot; which was about 10-15 kms from our homestay. That was a beautiful drive to the dam crossing the chamba valley on its treacheous roads. After half an hour or so, we reached the dam. To our luck, the sun was on its dawn. We stopped our car and just sat on the railing to feel the serene beauty. It was my first experience seeing the sun setting in mountains.After returning back to the hotel, we called it a day-off and rested.Chamba ValleyChamera DamView from the RoomDay 2DalhousieHotelsMapDay 2 started with a early morning drive to dainkund peak. Dainkund is the highest point in dalhousie at 3300 meters. Its about 12-15 kms from the mall road, dalhousie. There is a 1/2 km , steep walk upto a observation hut. It offers spectacular view of the Dhauladhar ranges. Bypassing this hut, one needs to follow a relatively easy walk along the ridge for another 1 km to reach temple of goddess Kali. For the religious minded , this is a good stopover as there is a lot of sentiment attached to this temple by the locals. For the not-so-religious minded, the point offers even more spectacular view of Kailash Parbat of Dhaula Dhar ranges. The view from the peak was mesmerising, I was not able to find words to describe that beauty.Before visitng dalhousie, I had only heard from friends and read on internet that dalhousie is also known as the mini-swiss of India, But after visiting the place and witnessing the beauty live from my eyes, I got to know why this place is called so. We spend a good 3 days at dalhousie and at the end we were not willing to return back.Dalhousie was the place where I got bitten by travel bug . After that I had travelled to many places till now and will look forward to continue. So, at last I will like to ask you guys, where you got bitten by travel bug?.Dainkund PeakDainkundOn the way to Dainkund",

		"Text": "After lot of discussions me my husband finalized Bali as one of our honeymoon destination. May is considered one of the best month to visit this island. The most striking thing about Bali is its clean and wide roads. The daily rhythm of life in Bali is seductive but if you want to head out and explore around the island, here are a few of my favorites.Getting Around in Bali and planning your day tripsRenting a car and driving it yourself isn&#x2019;t ideal in Bali as rental cars are expensive, roads can frequently be narrow, and the traffic manic. However if you&#x2019;re confident driving a scooter, we&#x2019;d definitely recommend getting one in Bali. A rental scooter costs anything between $3 &#x2013; $5 per day, so it&#x2019;s extremely cost effective.Now that the logistics are out of the way, let me tell you about some of my favorite trips and excursions in Bali.\nDay 1Mount BaturHotelsMap1. Mount BaturMount BaturHotelsMapLet&#x2019;s be honest &#x2013; how many times do you get to hike an active volcano in the dead of the night, reach the summit and stare at one of the prettiest sunrises in the world, examine black lava rocks lining the slopes after the last eruption, and boil an egg using the steam from the volcano? Those are just a couple of reasons why you might want to head to Mt. Batur when you&#x2019;re in Bali. If you don&#x2019;t wanna trek enjoy serine view while having lunch.CelukHotelsMap2. Celuk VillageCelukHotelsMapCeluk Village in Ubud is formerly as a traditional Balinese village located in the entrance gate of Gianyar Regency ad has changed into a tourist attraction with its trademark in the form of gold and silver. The village located in Sukawati District, Gianyar Regency has the uniqueness and excellent in production of gold and silver handicrafts. Almost all the families and villagers are Balinese who professional, skilled and art soul to develop the creative design and variety of products related to the gold and silvers. This craft village with long historical has been producing gold and silvers that penetrating the local, national and international markets. Various type of jewelry, either as souvenirs or export commodities are produced in this village includes variation type of rings, necklaces, earrings, hairpins, brooch and others. In addition to this, the artisans at Celuk Village are responding to the market demands and also produce the modern products such as medal, models and culture symbols.Day 2Bebek Teba Sari RestaurantHotelsMap3. Coffee &amp; Tea PlantationBebek Teba Sari RestaurantHotelsMapBebek Teba Sari Resto, a restaurant that looks like a romantic, traditional culinary escape bordered by rice fields. Our tour of the working plantation included a wide variety of coffee plants and herbs used to make some very unusual and delicious selections from the natural ingredients grown on site. The flavors were robust and exhilarating. My favorite coffees: ginger, ginseng, spicy chocolate and star anise. Outstanding tea tastes included: ginger, lemongrass, ginseng and rosella.SeminyakHotelsMap3. Seminyak SpaLinger within the serenity of our Seminyak Spa in Bali with its hand-painted wall murals, colored glass windows, and boudoir-inspired chill-out lounges. Relish an indulgent menu of massage, body treatments, facials and luxuriant flower-petal baths. Accents of Indonesian and Balinese tradition blend naturally-sourced ingredients with time-honored skills to yield therapies that work on mind, body and soul.Our day 3 was pretty much free in morning so we decided to wake up late and see local market near our resort.Day 3Jimbaran BeachHotelsMap4. Jimbaran BeachEnjoy a romantic candlelight dinner at any restaurant. Spend the night gazing at stars and basking yourself in lovely weather Jimbaran BeachHotelsMapOne of the big draws here is that you can get huge mixed platters of seafood which is a great pick if you are travelling in a group or with a family and all the seafood is simply grilled and served with their special spicy sauce.Bali is perfect vacation spot especially if you are planning a short vacation but wanna make it imperishable.",

The animal shelter is home to several old, abandoned donkeys providing them much needed shelter from the extreme conditions. Make sure you pick up some carrots to feed the innocent creatures when visiting this quirky sanctuary.Cuisine on offerOwing to the fact that Nyarma is an abandoned site completely in ruins, there is absolutely nothing around for foodies. However, Leh makes for one the best places to visit in Ladakh if you want to treat yourself to an authentic gastronomical adventure. Here are some of the best places to eat in Leh that you must visit the next time you&apos;re in the region:\nBon AppetitHotelsMap  \tBest Restaurant In Leh Ladakh - Lamayuru RestaurantHotelsMap  \tCoffee Culture LadakhHotelsMap  \tBest time to visit NyarmaSince Nyarma falls in an extremely remote region, it is only accessible during some parts of the year. The months between April to June make for the peak tourist season in the region. On the other hand, you can also plan a trip between mid-September and mid-October, just after the rains have subsided but the harsh winters are yet to kick in.Getting thereHere&apos;s how you can reach Nyarma from New Delhi:By air: All major air airlines now operate direct, daily flights between New Delhi and Leh . Once you get down at the Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport in Leh, hire a local cab to get to the ruin site in about an hour (30km).By road: If you&apos;re looking to go all out, drive down from Delhi to Nyarma because this journey will exactly be the stuff bucket lists are made of. The once-in-a-lifetime drive of 1,040km takes about 30 hours and tests your skills on the road, one turn at a time.Getting around in LadakhOwing to its remote location, getting around in Ladakh region is both tricky as well as expensive. It is best advisable to read up well on shared taxi rates from Point A to B while planning your trip and make a budget accordingly. If you&apos;re someone who doesn&apos;t mind rickety journeys, you can also hop on to state-run buses which are extremely cheap. Make sure you have a gist of the bus timetables as the frequency is again very limited.AccommodationIf you&apos;re planning to go out and about exploring Nyarma, the most feasible stay options will be about 25km from the ruin site in Leh, one of Ladakh&apos;s top tourist places. Here are some of the top choices in Leh you can consider on your trip to Ladakh:The Grand Dragon LadakhHotelsMapA stay for two at this ultra luxury resort starts at &#x20B9;12,000 per night, inclusive of a hearty buffet breakfast.Mantra CottageHotelsMapA stay for two at Mantra Cottage starts at &#x20B9;3,500 a night, inclusive of breakfast.HosteLaVie LehHotelsMapYou can get a bunk bed at HostelLaVie for as low as &#x20B9;359 a night, inclusive of breakfast.Note: Nyarma is nothing less than a national treasure. If you&apos;re planning to visit the ruin site, make sure you do it responsibly. Refrain from littering around the site and damaging the ruins in which way.

		"Text": "&quot;Italy has changed. But Rome is Rome.&quot; -Robert De Nero\nOur last leg of The Italian Adventure took us to the eternal city of Rome. The third most-visited city in the world with 20 million visitors in 2017, Rome is a m&#xE9;lange of historical ruins and modern architecture. The city is full of sights, with thousands of years of history lying there. It has everything here from Roman ruins to Renaissance art to fantastic food. Rome is there to be soaked in and enjoyed. Rome has an immensely rich cultural heritage, which makes it one of Europe&apos;s most stunning cities to visit.We had 3 days in Rome which surely is not enough to see everything that the city has to offer, but it&apos;s definitely enough to see all the highlights. To get the most out of your trip and to be sure you see all the major attractions, you will need to do a bit of planning and even reserve your entry time to the key attractions like Vatican, St. Peters Basilica, Colosseum etc. Chose between Omnia Rome &amp; Vatican Pass and you should be good.We start with the Vatican. A country of its own, inside Rome, is home to world-famous sites including the Vatican Museum, the Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter&apos;s Basilica. Oh and the Pope! Come early and head straight to Vatican Museums. Pick and choose what you want to see because this alone can take most of your time. Vatican Museums is the fifth-largest art museum in the world by gallery space and houses absolute masterpieces by prominent artists like Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, il Perugino and Caravaggio. Another star attraction here is Raphael&apos;s Rooms. The rooms used to be part of the private apartments of Pope Julius II, who entrusted the frescoes to Raphael and few were completed by his students. Then comes the highlight. The Sistine Chapel. It is awe-inspiring and breathtaking. I was excited about this after reading Da Vinci Code and the movie, but being here is an experience. Built in 1477 and various artist contributed to decorating it, but it is the ceiling and front wall that gets all the attention. It is said that starting in 1508 Michelangelo painted around 5000 square feet by himself in four years. The front wall depicts the Last Judgement while that famous scenes on the ceiling include the Creation of Adam. The Sistine Chapel is a historic building of such acclaim that over five million people come to visit it every year - that&apos;s equal to the population of Norway! And they don&apos;t allow you to stand and admire the ceiling and one has to keep moving. Quickly grab a corner area and pick a place. Then you can take your own good time inside. Exits Sistine chapel and enter St. Peters Basilica. The world&apos;s largest church, and what is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. With designers including Bramante, Raphael and Michelangelo, it&apos;s a truly Renaissance building, and is a work of art in itself.What next? We head to The Spanish Steps. Made famous by the 1953 movie Roman Holiday, starring Audrey Hepburn, this 135 step staircase was opened in 1735 to link the Spanish Embassy near the bottom of the steps to the Trinita dei Monti staircase at the top, and is popular spot to stop, eat Gelato, and watch the world go by. Don&apos;t forget to pick up the famous Venchi&apos;s gelato before heading towards the crowded Trevi Fountain. The world&apos;s largest Baroque fountain, is crowded whatever time of day (or night!) you visit. it is said that if you throw a coin into the fountain, you are guaranteed to return to Rome.A short walk from the Trevi Fountain lies the incredible Pantheon. This building, which has stood for almost 2,000 years, is the best preserved Ancient Roman monument in Rome and it is impressive and how! Originally built as a temple to the Roman gods, the Pantheon was converted for use as a Christian church in 609 AD, which is the main reason it survives in such excellent condition today. It&apos;s also notable for being home to the grave of Raphael and two Italian Kings. It still holds the record as the world&apos;s largest unenforced concrete dome.Rome is full of piazzas and surely pizzas. While we visitied a number of those our favourite remains the popular Piazza Navona and its most famous feature - Bernini&apos;s fountain. This has been a designated public space since the 15th century, and is full of gorgeous Baroque architecture. The area is full of street performers and markets and is always buzzing. Another of my favourite areas to chill or spend the evening was Piazza Venezia or Venice Square. Buy a Colosseum ticket and you get entry there alongwith Roman Forum &amp; Palatine Hill (as long as you visit on the same day). Roman Forum and Palantine hill shows the life in Rome as it was in the goold old days. This was the seat of power during the reign of the Roman Empire, as well as the central marketplace and business district. The Roman life for centuries revolved around this area of Rome. The Palatine Hill is considered to be the birthplace of the Italian capital and is believed to have been inhabited since the year 1000 B.C.Walk around the colorful Trastevere. This funky, bohemian area is known for traditional and innovative trattorias, craft beer pubs and artisan shops, as well as simple B&amp;Bs and budget hotels.And then comes the blockbuster. The Colosseum. Trust me I was jumping like a kid when I saw this. It is as grand as anything can be and exactly like I have seen it in pictures and imagined it. Said to be only 8 meters shorter than the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and covering a total area of 6 acres (24,000 m2), the Colosseum is the world&apos;s largest amphitheater ever built. Despite suffering some damage in it&apos;s two thousand years of existence, is still hugely impressive . With accommodation for 60,000 seated and 10,000 standing, all of whom could enter and leave in a matter of minutes, courtesy of 80 entrances, it&apos;s a spectacular architectural feat. One can feel the adrenaline rush as you walk the arena floor. It is really the superstar among the stars of Rome. There is a lot more in Rome like The Appian way, villa Borghese Gardens, churches to visit but depending on the time you have you can pick. To get around Rome the local transport is the best. Take one of the discount cards and you can get access to the sites as well as transport. If you aren&apos;t interested in the Vatican attractions, or are going to visit them on a walking tour, you should definitely consider the Roma Pass instead. This includes transport and a number of other attractions in Rome.A rich history, cobble stoned paths, stunning architecture, centuries-old palaces - Rome has it all. I don&apos;t know I will get a chance to visit it again but I would want to come back. My time in this beautiful city was mostly spent eating, drinking, wandering the streets, and soaking in as much of the culture and history as I could. It will make you fall in love.",

People say that this temple was made from work on just single stone although the height of temple is around 180 ft it&apos;s still a mystery how people would have been able to make such a tall temple at that time.Clicking pictures are prohibited inside the temple so I can&apos;t give you the pictures but let me tell you there are more than 100 small cave type temples inside this temple so many shivlings are there and there are so many dedicated workers who make Prashad which is given to god and the food available here is so yum and please don&apos;t forget to taste &quot;Pokhara bhat&quot; which is made of curd and rice trust me its available only in Orissa and it tastes heavenly. People from different parts of the country gather here on occasion of Shivratri (around one lakh) and if I tell you on regular basis more than thousand people visit every day. It&apos;s famous because in this temple shiv and Vishnu is worshiped at the same time. So come and visit this place you will love it.",

There is a lot more to do in Goa apart from lazing around on beaches, I replied with a chuckle! She gave me a surprised gaze as if I had said something in a foreign language.Goa is not just a place, it is a bag full of experiences. A mystery that keeps surprising you with its beauty every time you try to unfold a layer of it. With a coastline of 100 km and the green blanket of western ghats running through entire state, Goa is the gem of Konkan.Starting the day with home cooked idlis and nariyal (coconut) chutney, we started on our quest to unfold the beauty of Goa away from the beaches. Our first stop was going to be Harvalem Waterfall situated in Sanquelim which is almost 40 km from Panjim. Apart from waterfall, the place has historical importance too. It houses Harvalem caves and a temple of Lord Shiva.Mandovi river The ride to Sanquelim started from Panjim with Mandovi river on one side and old Portuguese style houses on the other. As we went further, the western ghats painted in various shades of green started taking over. The ride was quite bumpy at times but the beautiful weather and green surroundings were so captivating that we didn&apos;t care about the narrowness of road at few patches. After an hour long drive, we had finally reached Harvalem but in order to witness the beauty of it, we still had to burn some calories going down the stairs.\nHarvalem WaterfallHotelsMapHarvalem WaterfallThe sound of falling water led us to this mesmerising site. As the small droplets of water sprinkled on our face, the feeling of being refreshed outshined the fatigue. I couldn&apos;t stop myself from clicking pictures of this pristine beauty from various angles. Contrary to my expectation, the place had a lot of tourists but at the same time, not too many to make the place look overcrowded.Temple of Lord Shiva at Harvalem WaterfallAfter refuelling with a plate of Goan bhaaji paav (which is basically vatana (peas) curry) and seeking blessings of Lord Shiva, we set out to our next destination, Sahakari Spice Farm located at Ponda.Sahakari Spice FarmHotelsMapEntrance of Sahakari Spice FarmSpread across 130 acres of land, the spice plantation itself covers ~60 acres of the farm land. It was half past two and we were famished, so we decided to hog on the food first. After a delectable Goan meal we proceeded to the waiting area from where the tour was supposed to start.Sipping on ginger flavoured lemongrass tea, we patiently waited for our guide. The tour of spice garden started with the guide sharing information about various spices used in Indian household on a daily basis, which covered farming techniques as well as medicinal uses of those spices.Inside Sahakari Spice FarmInside Sahakari Spice FarmInside Sahakari Spice FarmInside Sahakari Spice FarmInside Sahakari Spice FarmThe tour also covered information about cashew and banana plantation.

The tour ended with a customary tradition of pouring a cup of cold water stored in earthen pots on our backs which made us feel refreshed after a half an hour long walk in the farm.Inside Sahakari Spice FarmAfter having another cup of lemongrass tea we started our return journey to Panjim. Nothing can beat a hot water bath and a home cooked authentic Goan food being served for dinner after an enjoyable yet tiresome day! With a heart overwhelmed with breathtaking views through the day and a satisfied tummy I fell asleep thinking about how perfect the day had gone by.Goa is a lot more than beaches, booze and parties. In order to unravel other facets of this place, all it takes is a little bit of willingness to research on the hidden treasures of this smallest yet one of the most beautiful and diverse states in India.Traveller tips:Tambdi Surla waterfall, which is another beautiful waterfall in Goa which lies 37 km south of Harvalem waterfall can also be on your list. We had to drop this spot because of my limitations from travelling due to back pain.\tThe ticket for Sahakari spice farm includes lunch, welcome drink and half an hour guided tour. The cost of ticket is INR 400/- per head.\tParking at the spice farm is a bit mismanaged during lunch hours.\tTravel responsibly by not throwing plastic waste in these places so that the coming generations also get to enjoy the beauty of these places the way we do today.To read more about my travel experiences, please follow my blog: nomadicmeteor.com",

		"Text": "BaliHotelsMapOur first day started off with us finding our villa booked via AirBnb. Our villa was a gorgeous 5 bedroom apartment&#xA0; with a pool, kitchen , living area and more than enough room for the 6 of us staying there. After settling in , we decided to catch up with a friend who incidentally was already in Bali. We went to Naughty Nooris and had quite a blast. They have these 3 drink challenges , I know what you&apos;re thinking , 3 drinks isn&apos;t that much. Trust me , these drinks were potent and left 2 of our friends quite done for the night at just 11pm!! After an amazing meal we decided to drop our friends off at the villa and the few of us who could still walk straight went to La Favella which was just a street away from our villa. I had heard quite a bit about La Favella before going there and it was more than I imagined. Good crowd , good music and tasty drinks. Me and my friends danced ourselves to glory and called it a night. Day 2This day we decided to take our time and only got out of bed at around 11am. We went and roamed around Seminiyak for a bit and then headed to the place I looked forward to the most in this trip - The Bali Swing!!! We reached and I must admit that it was a bit underwhelming in the beginning. I was quite certain the rest of my friends were really just being polite and indulging me by being there. Then we got on to the swings, that&apos;s when the fun started. It gives you butterflies even though you know you are tied into your seat. Swinging off a cliff with just the dip in front of you is quite nerve wracking. After a couple of the small swings we headed down towards the restaurant for lunch which was included in the ticket price (500,000 IDR) . The restaurant was a really cute set up with a small buffet with a waterfall in the background. After our hunger was satiated , we went and took ALOT of cute pictures in the nests and other small swings. Then it was time for the big boy , the Bali swing we were waiting for. This needed a harness just to keep us on the swing. This made me really nervous and excited! The build up while waiting in line and watching the others is just as much a part of the experience as the actual swing. This was the big daddy of the swings and I thoroughly enjoyed it.&#xA0; After an exhilarating time we started our journey back to Seminiyak at about 5pm. A quick change and we started out to do a spot of shopping and then dinner. We went to Botega Italiana which had amazing home made pasta dishes. We of course over ordered and also over ate! We headed home soon after because our next day was going to be super early and very very exciting!Day 3On our third day we woke up at 1am (yeah , you read that right 1AM!) and met our driver to take us to Mount Batur! I&apos;ll be the first to admit that my reasons for going was mostly because I didn&apos;t want to let my sister go alone. But I am so glad I went. We reached our meeting point with our young guide (17 years ,guys!) and then our trek started. Being a trek virgin I expected this to be quite difficult for me, but I was pleasantly surprised with my stamina! The trek was by no means easy but I wouldn&apos;t categorise it as tough either. Yes I did get out of breath a couple times and I did need a few breaks in between but the view from the top is more than worth the trouble. We were lucky that our guide was just for my sister and me, we did notice that most of the other guides had groups of 10-15 people. We reached the top in about 2.5 hours or so and got there in enough time to catch the sunrise. Our guide brought us hot chocolate which we used to warm up our freezing hands (yes, it gets pretty cold up on Mount Batur). Our breakfast (included in the fee of 45$) consisted of boiled egg and a banana sandwich. It wasn&apos;t giving any restaurant a run for their money but hey with a view like that I could be eating cardboard and I&apos;d be happy &#x1F601;. The sun started rising and a random trekker took out his guitar and sang a couple songs. This was truly the highlight of my time in Bali! Then it was time to head down. It was quite steep and I did land on my derriere&#xA0; a couple times &#x1F60B; but it was still fun . I slept through the entire drive (2hrs) back to our villa. I was zonked and all I needed was my bed.After a nice nap , we woke up and headed out for lunch. We spotted this food truck called Hallal Boys and the bowls were really good. I had a lamb bowl which came with rice and sauces along with mince lamb and I destroyed that bowl. Once our tummy&apos;s were satisfied we went to meet up with the rest of the gang at The W. We read our Google map wrong and instead of an&#xA0; 8 min journey by car we thought it was an 8 min walk! &#x1F648;&#x1F648; We did our second trek by walking to The W anyway &#x1F602;. The W is a superb hotel with amazing service, after a nice couple of beers and stroll along the beautiful beach it was time to hit the pool. With the serene sunset as our background we had a great time in the pool and enjoyed the rest of the evening there.Time for dinner and we found this cute little place called Nook. With a mix of German and Indonesian cuisine this place was the perfect end to our night.Mount BaturSunrise at Mount BaturBeach at The WDay 4Our last day in Bali , we decided to wake up bright and early and head out for breakfast. We went to Cafe Organic and I could not leave Bali without having an acai bowl. It was cold and refereshing and just what I needed. We enjoyed our breakfast in this really cute place and walked back to our villa to pack and leave heaven. Bali has something for everyone , from thumping pubs to Mount Batur to the numerous temples it can keep anyone and everyone happy . It can give you varied experiences and all of them will be breathtaking .",

To my surprise, I was the only Indian in the bus with all my fellow passengers being Chinese. It was a 5 days trip and I bonded a bit with a Chinese lady, named Lana Kuo, onboard. It was one hectic tour and the bus made very few stops - mostly on the highway. Unfortunately, most of the places where they stopped for a lunch or dinner break were non-vegetarian- with almost zero vegetarian options. Not even fries!I expected this and I survived on the food I was carrying, but I didn&apos;t have a proper meal in four days. On our last day, when I got off from the bus at San Francisco, me and few other passengers, checked into a hotel. I was waiting at the reception for my room keys and Lana was waiting for her husband to pick her up. When her husband arrived, Lana came to me to say good bye. We hugged and she handed me a packet. I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was and then she said, &quot;I am a teacher at a pre-school here and in my class there are few vegetarian students. We prepare mid-day meals in school and for these vegetarian students, we prepare vegetarian meal. I asked my husband to pack a lunch box for you because you haven&apos;t eaten properly during the whole trip. I am sorry it is not the best kind of vegetarian food but it is what I could manage here&quot;. She also handed me her business card and asked me to call her in case I need any help. I was so touched by her small gesture and hugged her back and thanked her several times for her kindness. I went up to my room and heated the food. I must say that it was not the best meal I had- but it was definitely the best meal I had in four days. And certainly one of the meals that I cherish till date. Thanks Lana for your kindness!",

		"Text": "So I had these non refundable flight tickets to Bangalore for an event which got cancelled at the last moment. What do I do, I thought to myself. I was left with two options, either to cancel the tickets or to go solo. And yes, you&apos;ve guessed it right! I chose the latter.After a sleepless night full of excitement about the trip and fear of missing the early morning flight, I finally made it to the airport on time. Right outside the Bangalore airport terminal, my &apos;flybus&apos; to Mysore was waiting at the KSRTC bus stop. Cutting through Bangalore traffic and crossing patches full of rain water, the bus was finally on the Mysore highway. The road to Mysore passes through various towns which makes it necessary for the driver to keep the speed under control. The journey was getting boring after 3 hours but as the bus reached Srirangapatna, the excitement was back.Somewhere on the way to MysoreI was back in this royal city aka the cultural capital of Karnataka once again after 20 long years. The trip was impromptu but the plan was in place. The first leg of the trip was to check in to this cool backpacker&apos;s hostel, The Mansion, 1907 which is situated hardly a kilometre away from the bus stand, I quickly prepared a list of places that could be covered in the little time I had. I found an auto-rickshaw with the help of hostel&apos;s housekeeper, who would take me around the city.The Mansion, 1907\nThe Mansion 1907HotelsMapYoga Galley of The MansionMy first pitstop was at St. Philomena&apos;s church which is one of the oldest churches in South Asia and is known for its Gothic style architecture. Clicking pictures of this church was quite difficult considering the height of the building. But after literally lying on the floor at a distance, I managed to click few pictures of this epitome of architecture.St. Philomena&#x27;s ChurchHotelsMapSt. Philomena&#x27;s Church, The epitome of Gothic Architecture in IndiaAfter quickly finishing up lunch, I set out to Chamundi Hill which is about 13 km away from Mysore city.Not bad for 50 bucks!From the top of the hill, an aerial view of the entire Mysuru city can be seen. It is famous for Shri Chamundeshwari Temple of Shri Chamundi or Durga which is the tutelary deity of Mysore Maharajas. The temple was overflowing with devotees and I was running short of time so I decided to buy ticket of express queue for 100 bucks. Within 15 mins I was done with darshan and was out of the temple clicking pictures.Sri Chamundeshwari TempleHotelsMapStatue of Mahishasura at Chamundi HillsShri Chamundeshwari TempleWhile getting down from Chamundi hill, I took a detour to the famous Nandi (holy bull) of Mysuru. But to my disappointment, the statue of Nandi was under renovation and the place had become a hideout for the couples. So, I decided to head to Mysore Sand Sculpture Museum, which is basically a collection of various types of idols made of sand that portray various religions and festivals of our culturally diverse country.Mysore Sand Sculpture MuseumHotelsMapBy the time I reached Jaganmohan Palace, which is also an art gallery, it was 5:00 pm and I decided to skip taking the tour of the art gallery and quickly proceeded to Mysore Palace.Jaganmohan Palace Art Gallery And AuditoriumHotelsMapMysore PalaceHotelsMapAs I reached Mysore Palace, the memories of my last Mysore trip (that I took 20 years back) came back to me like a fresh breeze. So many things about this place had changed and so many were still the same. The palace is surrounded with a large garden and is under strict security. The beautiful walls, silver doors, chandeliers, the artwork made on the ceilings and pillars, etc. inside the palace took me back to the era of royalty. I wondered how much effort must have been put in to make this exemplary structure of art. As I stood in front of the palace admiring its beauty, I didn&apos;t realise that it was closing time and the guards had started pushing people outside the premises of the palace. Since, it was Saturday, the palace was not going to be decorated with lights at night which of course was a disappointment.As I sat in silence, sipping on hot coffee, my thoughts were swinging through the day with the swing I was sitting on. The places I had visited through the day had taken me down the memory lane and the nostalgia was hitting hard, in a pleasant way.But the day was not over yet and I was yet to try the famous Mylari Dosa at Vinayaka Mylari. The speciality of this eatery is that the menu has only 3 options, viz. sada dosa, masala dosa and filter coffee. Never had I tasted such a fluffy yet crispy dosa in my life, that too for 40 bucks only! I thought to myself that the best things in life come for such a nominal price.Hotel Vinayaka MylariHotelsMapThe famous Mylari Dosa at My next destination was going to be Guru Sweet Mart, which is the only place where you get the authentic Mysore Pak in India. The small window of the shop was blocked by customers but I somehow managed to get a piece for myself to taste. And let me tell you the taste was heavenly. The moment I took a bite of this sweet loaded with desi ghee, it just melted into my mouth. All these sweet shops that claim to make Mysore Pak are fooling customers all over India. If you really want to taste the real Mysore Pak then Guru Sweet Mart is the place to be.The day was quite eventful and tiring but the feeling of being solo was liberating. The next destination was going to be Bengaluru for which I had to catch an early morning train.My one day trip to Mysore had come to an end and I bid goodbye to this beautiful city thinking about how perfectly everything went. And that&apos;s when I realised that I had forgotten to give the room key back to the housekeeper and now it was too late to do that. So, I decided to keep the key as a memory of this impromptu yet fulfilling trip.To read more about my travel experiences, please visit and follow my website: nomadic meteor.com",

		"Text": "Out of nowhere, I decided that I should visit Russia. The other reason was I had a friend there whom I could meet. So, I got my Visa from Russian Consulate at Mumbai. It&#x2019;s a quick, cheap and fairly easy process. Only weird thing is that you need to get a tourist voucher from a recognised travel agent based in Russia. There are ample of web sites that provide such tourist voucher letter online costing 12 to 20 Euros. You can also ask your accommodation provider to provide you for free. I visited the Russian Consulate personally; the lady at the counter asked me some basic questions on the purpose of visit, date of return, etc. Mine was a challenging case because I wanted to enter Russian land by road from Estonia. I had no clue, no information on internet on how feasible it is, still I took a chance. I decided to visit only one city, St. Petersburg for 9 days as I wanted to deeply experience the city culture. I had my hostels pre booked online. Accommodations are fairly cheap in St. Petersburg. I paid around 55USD for 9 days for top rated hostels (That&#x2019;s a steal!).So, May arrived, I packed my bags and I was ready to go, standing here outside my door, I didn&#x2019;t know really what to expect from Russia. The picture painted in my mind was of old grey soviet-era buildings with huge photographs of Putin hanging on them, Stalin statues here and there, and serious-looking people in military uniforms shouting Communist slogans all around. Ohh and I had also read there are millions of Single Russian women due to gender imbalance who are waiting to grab foreigners by their hand. That was fairly a fascinating and scary picture of the country I had!I had booked a bus ride from Tallinn to St. Petersburg. Apparently, I was the only brown guy in a bus full of Russian and Estonian people. At the start of the journey, the driver handed out an immigration form for foreigners to fill. I realised I was not carrying a pen with me. Panicked, I Google translated on how to ask people for a Pen in Russian. I succeeded to get one and later thanked Engineers at Google. Lady who borrowed me Pen was very nice that she gave me a pen as a gift saying I may need it later on. Well, that made my day! Bus passed though Narva which is the last Estonian city to the border. Finally, the day arrived when I reached Russian border. There were 3-4 checks performed, some on the Estonia side and some on Russian just doing Passport and luggage scans. The Border patrol officer seemed to be surprised seeing me. Her eyes rolling, she could not anticipate who is this guy from India crossing a border from Europe to Russia for tourism purpose. It took longer than usual for me but it went fairly smooth. The whole process took around 45 minutes that&#x2019;s because you need to wait until all the passengers pass border control. The border crossing was well organised and damn beautiful. There is a castle on the border, a beautiful garden and people taking stroll with their dogs like any city center garden. Finally, I was on the Russian land, my hands yaying as if I conquered a city. This was the first time ever I crossed a restricted border by land.I reached St. Petersburg bus station in the afternoon. I had 2 options either to catch a metro or a taxi ride to the hostel. For some reasons I always prefer public transport over comforting taxi rides even if taxis cost same as public transport, And taxis are super cheap in St. Petersburg. That&#x2019;s probably because I get to experience the local feel of the city.I reached hostel which was located in Ligovsky Prospekt, took a shower and went out searching for a lunch. Entered couple of local restaurants and just came out as I could not understand the ABC of what they are serving. Finally, ate at KFC, the safest choice! In the later days, I did try local delicacies. Hostel was super clean and staff was very friendly however, boring as they did not had a single tourist. There were mostly locals and students living there. Staff went way beyond their limits in helping me out with queries related to sightseeing or even filing a registration with the government. There is another weird requirement from Russian government that if you plan to spend more than 7 days in Russian territory, you have to register your stay with the government authorities. Luckily, hostel staff took care of this for me.Later in the night, I decided to hit the night life, visited a club named DOM 7 as they were playing a Live Jazz band. Place was crowded and people were enjoying at full. Later, I thought I should visit another club named Purga which is known for celebrating New Year eve every night of the year. I reached their gate and the clowns did not let me in (Well, the Guards were dressed as clowns apparently). I was shocked, this was my first ever encounter with racism outside India. I felt deeply insulted despite experiencing severe racism in India. Then I found a noble way to relieve my anger, I gave them zero ratings over social media ????After 5 days, I moved to another hostel named Chill Out and it lived to its name. This hostel was the exact opposite of the earlier one, one of the best hostel stays I have ever done. The lady managing it was awesome. She had never travelled to India but knew a lot about Indian culture. Her mom had been to India twice. The common area was full of collectibles, musical instruments &#x2013; a guitar, ukulele, piano, mandolin and balalaika, board games, awesome art works and 5 pets. And she was an artist herself. She made me felt like I was at her home. She treated me with home cooked bliny, herbal and Peur tea multiple times. She even taught me how to do a tea ceremony and please the tea God, and allowed me to play all her instruments. Later, On St. Petersburg day she took me to the roof top of a 150+ year old building to see the fireworks. This was the most dangerous climb I have ever done as we had to walk on the slanting roof top without much support. Hostel was full of locals&#x2019; long time stayers but pretty chilled people. One of the young Russian guy in my room carried a copy of Bhagwad Geeta, would light incense stick (agarbatti) every morning, chant some mantra, play soothing Zen Buddha music and would roll a joint to start off his day! The guy was living his life! Amazing guy to converse with. The best part is when they share some unique cultural insights about India which we just take it for granted like Baba standing on one feet forever, ladies wearing bindi and snake charmers.On the other days, I met my friend who took me to a beach-like river front and to Kronstadt, a small naval town in St. Petersburg. The river front was quite an experience; with rich Russians chilling out in Cafe, folks playing volleyball, youngsters walking around with songs playing on full volume on their JBL&#x2019;s, a women dropping her pants and taking pee in open air, and couple making out on the sand! Nobody gave a damn about others. Later, I had a lunch at her house and she bought raw horse meat for me to eat. Well, I did try it but it felt like eating a semi-liquid state plastic. I just could not chew it; you need super powerful horse-like teeth to chew it. And she just ate it like a waffle!Overall, nine days were spent great. It&#x2019;s a great 18th-century city of remarkable grandeur, slowly reviving from its Communist era. With their colorful, playful Baroque facades, its buildings exude the opulence of Tsarist Russia, but are more European in essence than the Kremlin domes of Moscow. It was from St Petersburg that the tsars ruled Russia for two centuries until their downfall in 1917. City is full of historical museums, art and amazing architecture. There is a great European influence and you do feel European culture and vibes on the streets. City has lots of canals flowing in every corner of the city. It&#x2019;s also called as the Venice of the North. People are helpful and kind in general however; very few people speak English. You would experience some dose of unpleasant experience if you cannot converse in Russian. Like, Enquiring for a transport card in the sub way station was next to impossible for me. I had to then Google, thank engineers at Google again and read the information on internet and then find somebody close to the ticket counter who can converse in English. Even buying a SIM card and asking the sales guys to explain me internet plans was almost impossible. On other day, I ended up booking an Opera ticket instead of a Ballet because of language barrier. Well, the Opera did turn out to be a great experience ultimately. Opera was in Italian and I believe no other language can ever do justice to Operas. Italian must have been born for Operas. Your fondness towards Italian language would grow multifold if you ever watch an Italian opera. And then I had to book a ballet show for another day. Even ballet was quite an interesting experience. You just wonder how somebody can walk on their toe the entire time.Hermitage museum is a must-do thing if you are in the city. You need one full day to tour and perhaps few days if you are a serious history/art freak. They have Michelangelo and Picaso&#x2019;s work on display. It&#x2019;s the second largest museum in the world. I read somewhere there are 427 museums in St. Petersburg city. It is called cultural capital of Russia for a reason. City has been home to some of the legends in the world of literature, art and music &#x2013; Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Nikolay Gogol, Tchaikovsky among few. I would definitely recommend watching a ballet, an Opera and an Orchestra in Mariinsky Theater to get the true royal feel. The theater was founded in year 1860 and is incredibly beautiful.Nevsky prospekt is another must-do thing. It&#x2019;s the main avenue and the most happening street in the city. It cuts through the historical center and several touristy spots in the city. The street looks like a grand carnival on Friday and Saturday evenings with people drinking (Vodka is cheaper than sprinkled water), singing, dancing all over the street. There is somebody busking on the street every 100 meters either an individual or a band, and people participate with high vigor. This is something that&#x2019;s unique to St. Petersburg. There must be more than 250 cafes, restaurants, and pubs on and around the Nevsky Prospekt Street.I was lucky I got to witness a white night in St Petersburg, with the Sun setting in too late or perhaps not setting at all. That&#x2019;s like a literal 24 hour day! Also, I got to experience a river bridge split opening on St. Petersburg day.On another day I went to one of the flea shop and flea market. It&#x2019;s the best flea market I have ever visited and you get authentic collectibles from the vintage era. I bought 90 souvenir items and the weirdest things I have ever bought with money including used library card, a driving license cover, dead film roll cameras, a wooden whiskey hip flask, school medals and dolls. One of the old lady seller I encountered happened to be a fan of Raj Kapoor and sang me one of his iconic songs and gave me a free souvenir as a token of appreciation. Well, I was flattered!If it&#x2019;s St. Petersburg, you definitely cannot afford to miss traveling on its subway stations. The system exhibits many typical Soviet designs and features exquisite decorations and artwork making it one of the most attractive and elegant metros in the world. Sometimes you feel like you have entered a noisy art gallery. Saint Petersburg Metro is also one of the deepest metro systems in the world. Escalators in some stations take as much as 140 seconds to reach the platform despite them operating at high speeds. They are so long that they have a full time lady operator sitting in a cabin below watching people over CCTV full time to safeguard any mishaps.Overall, it is a great city perfect for all kinds of travelers &#x2013; solo, couples, and family.Coming back to my initial picture of the city framed in my mind, I could conclude following&#x2013; I could not smell communism anywhere. City and culture appears as European as Paris or Berlin and totally capitalist. It&#x2019;s a bustling city with 10 Million+ people. Seeing so many people I felt like my home city, Mumbai&#x2013; There are no posters of Putin on the buildings&#x2013; There is no gender imbalance among young populationSome interesting things I noticed &#x2013;St. Petersburgians are huge in size, at least majority of them. And the men look real tough with their smile less faces. So, don&#x2019;t mess up with them.People usually do not smile much at strangers even when you converse with themPastries are incredibly cheap and absolutely yum yumBorsh(a beetroot soup), and bliny are worth a treatClimate gets cold even at the end of May monthAll buses have only mid aged/old ladies as conductors for some reasonsVodka is super cheap and youngsters drink like crazyHipster culture is very much visible on the streets. They truly believe in partying with their soul whether it&#x2019;s on the river front, a car, a club, a garden or in a crowded streetWomen are mostly pretty with great sense of fashionSocial Latin dancing scene is virtually non-existingRussian is a very sweet language.Most of the Russians I met could sing and dance on Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy aaja aaja aaja\t  \t\t  \t\t  \thttps://youtu.be/XLP5BQorO2U",

		"Text": "Day 1UdaipurHotelsMap&#x201C;Jobs fill your pocket, but adventures fill your soul.&#x201D;&#xA0;I subscribe to this thought in its entirety. Like most of us, I too have huge bucket list ranging from Machu Pichu, sahara desert, and the Amazon forest to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. Rajasthan was one of the items on that list. I have had always heard of the mesmerising and awe-inspiring grandeur of Rajput rulers and their remarkable achievements in art and architecture apart from their towering stature in warcraft.As it so happened, the first phase of our On Job Training was announced and fortunately, I was allotted Udaipur.I began making elaborate travel plans and by the end of of my research, I had equipped myself to act as a proper city guide. We landed in Udaipur on 16th July after a halt in city of dreams - Mumbai. The weather was very pleasant and continued to be so for the weeks to come.During the course of our OJT, we visited 6 key places - Udaipur, Kumbhalgarh, Mount Abu, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Jaisamand. Additionally, we also made trips to two lesser known destinations namely badi lake and pipliya ji.Udaipur: Known for its breathtaking scenery, majestic palaces, world-class museums and luxury hotels, Udaipur is steeped in history, having been home to successive generations of the Maharanas of Mewar. Placed alongside Fateh sagar and holding Pichola and Swarup Sagar in its arms, the city is a perfect destination for experiencing pleasure and good food.The first brush with Fateh Sagar made me a little disheartened for it seemed like any other lake. However, my sentiments turned out to be premature when the cloud cover dissipated and the true beauty of the lake emerged along with the sunshine.Places to see in Udaipur: lake pichola, lake fateh Sagar, city palace, monsoon palace, jagmandir, Saheliyo ki baadi, and Badi lake.Food: Specialities include laal maans @ Courtyard and Khamma Ghani, and lasuni palak at Hotel Tribute. One can have authentic Rajasthani food at gobardhan thal and Krishna Dal Bati restro. Handicraft: Bazaar near Jagdish temple, Hathipole(beware of overpricing), miniature paintings in the vicinity of Chand pole.My favourite experience: sitting at the pal on the shores of fatehsagar in the evening and listening to classical music and visiting the market near Jagdish Temple.Badi lake: This is a small lake situated 6 km from Fateh Sagar, on the outskirts of Udaipur. The road to Badi Lake is guarded by Monsoon Palace. Less crowded and undisturbed, it provides a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The ecotone mark developed and protected on the shores of Badi Lake offers a spectacular view of the lake. The lake also provides ample opportunities for birdwatchers.Pilpiya ji drive: This is the best route for those fond of bike rides. This 25-km trip from Udaipur is beautiful and passes through a fairly difficult terrain. Once you reach the highest peak of the village, you will experience fast-paced soothing winds and accompanied by clouds covering the mountains and a drizzle in the background.There is lot more to cover and see in rajsthan.. what we saw is mostly southern and western rajsthan.. but yes.. for the time being I would prefer to cherish these days and wait for the time when I can travel to other places. Dr Vasant Rajput. IRS.Jaisamand LakeHotelsMapDay 2Jaisamand lake: This was perhaps the peak point of our trip. The lake was constructed by Raja Jaisingh and is the second largest artificial lake in Asia. The boat ride up to the lake resort was akin to being in a scene from Game of Thrones due to tall mountains on either side. The sunset was breathtaking and the calmness on the shores of Jaisamand at dusk is difficult to express in words. Day 3Mount AbuHotelsMapMount Abu: The road journey was the most beautiful aspect of our trip to Mount Abu. This was my first experience in the Aravalis. Earlier I was of the opinion that nothing can match the beauty of the Sahyadris, particularly during monsoon. However, I had a change of heart when I saw the lush green Aravalis. I would&#xA0; recommend a bike ride to Mount Abu and Kumbhalgarh to experience one of the best drives of one&#x2019;s life.At mount Abu We stayed at ministerial cottages from where one can get the best possible view of Nakki lake. I woke up early next morning to catch a glimpse of the foggy morning. An evening boat ride around the lake provided for a perfect conclusion to my day. Dilwara temple:After witnessing beautiful landscapes, we moved towards the well known architectural marvel and gem of Rajasthan - the Dilwara Jain temple. The work in white sandstone is so intricate and creative that some regard it more beautiful than Taj Mahal. The exterior of the temple can be deceptive due to its remarkable simplicity. However, the temple interior showcases extraordinary work of human craftsmanship at its best. The detailed ornamentation over marble and judicious use of every inch is commendable.Day 4KumbhalgarhHotelsMapKumbhalgarh: A journey from Udaipur via Abu road highway to Kumbhalgarh and Haldighati offers one with an enchanting view of the forest of Kumbhalgarh and gives you a glimpse into the age old irrigation practice - Rahat. Placed in the hills like a nest and surrounded by forests, Kumbhalgarh is a standing testimony to Rajput valour and clever warcraft. It is the birth place of Maharana Pratap(the most revered Rajput king of Mewar). An overnight stay at resorts in kumbhalgarh is widely recommended to get a feel of the Aravalis.Day 5Mehrangarh FortHotelsMapJodhpur&#x2019;s Mehrangarh Fort:The blue city is not blue any more. But if one is keen on historical artifacts and weapons, this fort is the place for them. Miniature paintings depicting Mewar and marwar at the fort are also worth witnessing.Umaid Palace MuseumHotelsMapBeautiful architecture with collection of artifacts and watches. I found Trophies of the golf club very attractive.Day 6JaisalmerHotelsMapJaisalmer:The road trip from Udaipur to Jaisalmer is a unique experience in itself with deserted roads and sparse habitation. The endless highway gives you time to introspect over life. Jaisalmer reflects the culture and climate of Rajasthan that we, as tourists, imagine before setting foot in the state. The Sam sand dunes, camel rides , jeep rides across the desert and the golden landscape of the city make it a trip worth taking in one&#x2019;s lifetime. The desert wind that blows at night is very soothing after the scorching heat of the day.",

And they left, left behind them their graves that evince legacies of historical metamorphoses.India was under colonial rule for a long, long time, and had been home to foreign migrants from around the world. Their tombstones, epitaphs and graves, big and small here, have a story of a historic past, of war and losses, of pride and power &#x2013; footprints of foreign presence in India that are tell-tale reminders of lost lives. For those who want something out of the ordinary, here&apos;s a list of such colonial graveyards, some of which make it to India&apos;s most haunted places. Take your sweetheart out on a date to one of these hauntingly beautiful places for a fun-filled spooky experience!\t  \t\nSouth Park Street CemeteryHotelsMapEstablished in 1767, South Park Street Cemetery is Kolkata&apos;s oldest burial ground and one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world. Some of the notable British officers, poets, teachers and diplomats rest here. It accommodates exemplary Gothic and Indo-Saracenic graves, that make it an architectural beauty and a photographer&apos;s delight. Visit here to observe hauntingly beautiful memoirs, epitaphs, imposing graves and spooky experiences.Owned by: Archaeological Survey of IndiaQuirky quotient: Home to more than 1600 tombs, it is is considered one of the most haunted cemeteries in India. Many have experienced extreme dizziness, weird images and a general eerie feeling after visiting this cemetery. Would you dare visit?  \tSt. John in the WildernessHotelsMapAt a height of 5800 feet above sea level, sits an architectural marvel built in 1852 AD. It is next to the Anglican Church of St. John in the wilderness and is the burial ground of British lives lost in an earthquake in Mcleod Ganj. The church is built in Gothic style with Belgian stained-glass windows, and is a definite masterpiece.Owned by: Church of North IndiaQuirky Quotient: Famous British Viceroy Lord Elgin who died in 1863, rests here. Surrounded by tall pine and coniferous trees this cemetery is known for its tranquil beauty, Gothic feel and the horses that come to graze here every morning.  \tDutch CemeteryHotelsMapThe Portuguese rule in Kochi was followed by that of the Dutch for 110 years from 1663 to 1773. Thus, this cemetery became home to Dutch and English businessmen, traders, governors and soldiers who lost their lives while attempting to extend their territory.Built in arresting Dutch architectural style, this ancient cemetery has granite and red laterite tombs, with epitaphs engraved in Dutch and is infested with beautiful orange flowers and weed. It mostly remains closed, but is opened on request of visitors.Owned by: Church of South IndiaQuirky quotient: This cemetery was consecrated in 1724, and is India&apos;s oldest Christian cemetery. 1913 was the year when the last burial here took place of a certain Captain Joseph Ethelbert Winckler.  \tLothian CemeteryHotelsMapConsecrated in 1808, the Lothian cemetery is Delhi&apos;s oldest Christian burial ground. It cradles the remains of European soldiers who lost their lives during the Revolt of 1857. It is the resting place of the staff of East India Company, British women and children who fell prey to the cholera epidemic.Owned by: Archaeological Survey of IndiaQuirky quotient: Myths say that the British dug open the older graves to claim the burial grounds as their own, this left the spirits of the people already buried, infuriated. Even though their bodies were dug out, their spirits never left the place. So now the old ghosts and the newer ones have fights every night for claims over the graveyard. We come across high voltage property feuds every now and then, but this one surely takes the cake.  \tAnother popular horror story associated with Lothian.Scottish CemeteryHotelsMapPresent day Kolkata, was British India&apos;s administrative capital &#x2013; Calcutta, home to the headquarters of East India Company. Besides the British, the growing jute and tea industry invited many Scots to India, and with time their prominence grew manifold in EIC. This Scottish cemetery was, thus, consecrated in 1820 AD as a burial ground for the Scots. It shelters more than 2000 Scottish lives lost in the 19th century. The tombstones are made of Scottish sandstone and granite, bearing Scottish inscriptions, and are now mostly covered with weed and wild Indian flora.Owned by: Scottish Church of KolkataQuirky quotient: More than 1600 Scottish tombstones were actually made in and transported from Scotland in the 1800s, giving the graveyard a strong and compelling Scottish character.Indian Christian CemeteryHotelsMap  \tThe fascinating cold beauty of this cemetery is in stark contrast with the busy world of Bengaluru outside its walls. Ornamented with motifs of angels, gargoyles and crosses, this forlorn yet striking architectural piece was built in early 1800s, as a burial ground for British officers and their families.Owned by: British High CommissionQuirky Quotient: German horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel, who is credited with the city&#x2019;s green cover, rests here. He transplanted many foreign species in Bangalore, making it the garden city that it is. His grave was discovered here, only in 2007, more than 50 years after he died.  \tAntop HillHotelsMapBaha&apos;i Gulistan &amp; Armenian CemeteryEtched with floral motifs and canopied by trees and flowers, are the graves where the Persian souls rest. The Baha&apos;i faith finds its roots in India as far back as the early 1800s.And even before the Baha&apos;i community, Armenians arrived in Bombay in the 16th and 17th century from the Armenian Highland. These people from Tehran, Constantinople and Armenia, settled in Bombay and Calcutta majorly and had strong trade relations in India.Managed by: Baha&apos;i Community of MumbaiQuirky quotient: The Armenian community now has almost disappeared from Mumbai, there are a few living in Kolkata though. Thus, people from the Baha&apos;i faith now use the adjoining Armenian graveyard as their burial ground too. The Baha&apos;i people celebrate death, and thus, their graves are ornamented with flowers and golden engravings, making it a Gulistan. The Armenian graves are etched with beautiful Armenian epitaphs and eulogies.WorliHotelsMap  \tYou&apos;d be surprised to know how many communities from around the world made Bombay their home and also breathed their last there. Present day Bombay has sheltered Baha&apos;i, Armenian, Japanese, Chinese and even Jews from all over the world.The Jewish CemeteryJews have been a religious minority in India since time immemorial, as they were one of the first foreign religions to settle in India. They migrated from the Konkan coast to cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Their graveyard dates back to early 1900s, and is a sight to behold even in the present day.Managed by: Jewish Community in MumbaiQuirky Quotient: Popular Bollywood choreographers, architects, poets, historians and also the first umpire of a test match between India and England at Brabourne Stadium, Judah Reuben rest here.Have you been to any such creepy but interesting places?

		"Text": "Credits: SollakellaI still remember the first time I saw a marigold flower. It was during a puja at home and mom had asked the house help to get long garlands of the flower to decorate the doorway. I must have been about 6 or 7-years-old, and I vividly remember how mesmerised I was with the colour of the flower and also its structure. Marigolds have been a favourite ever since and perhaps the biggest reason I look forward to festivals. Recently, I had been looking for marigold pictures on Instagram for a DIY project, when I came across this gorgeous piece. \t  \tA little more research and I found out that it was taken at the Ghazipur Flower Market &#x2013; the largest of its kind in India! After that, it was just a spiral into the world of this mesmerising flower market and all that it has to offer. When you visit the Ghazipur Phool Mandi, on the face of it you might feel like you&apos;re just in a jumbled mess of shabby stalls and grimy bylanes. But as you enter the gates and go on exploring, you will find that it is indeed a mesmerising assault on the senses. You will immediately be taken in by the sights, sounds, and smells of India&apos;s largest flower market. Flower power\t  \tBeing the largest in India and in Delhi, this phool mandi is the ultimate spot for flower vendors and buyers like wedding vendors, retailers, flower sellers, and florists to do business. The functioning starts as early as 3am and goes on till 7pm in the evening with different time periods determining the rates of different flowers. If you happen to visit in the wee hours, you will be taken by the hustle-bustle of the mandi at a time when the entire city is supposed to be asleep. The shifting of power\t  \tUp until 2011, there were three different flower mandis thriving in different parts of Delhi (Connaught Place, Mehrauli, and Ghazipur). However, due to a government order back then, these mandis were made to shift base to one common ground in Ghazipur. There was a huge uproar because of this with protests from flower vendors across the city to no avail. The mandi in Ghazipur is situated next to a dumping ground and slaughterhouse, which has been a major cause of the muck and smell in the area. Starting this year, however, the flower mandi is in for a revamp with the temporary stalls being replaced by a four-story building spread across an area of 10 acres. The construction is expected to start by the end of this month and be completed by the end of the year 2020. Till then, florists have to deal with the issues of being set up next to a dumping ground. Situation now\t  \tEver since the flower market shifted to Ghazipur, it has definitely become the ultimate spot for buying and selling flowers. It is difficult to find a type or kind that is not available here. Flowers are not only imported but also exported from here. A photographer&apos;s delight\t  \tNeedless to say, this place is a gold-mine for photographers from all walks of life. Whether you want a backdrop for a fashion photoshoot or you want to get a glimpse of life in one Delhi&apos;s most exotic markets, Ghazipur Phool Mandi is a treasure trove with stalls upon stalls of regular and exotic flowers.How to get here\t  \tThe Ghazipur Flower Mandi is located in East Delhi, near the Uttar Pradesh border. Areas such as Mayur Vihar, Kondli, Preet Vihar, and Laxmi Nagar fall in its vicinity. While you can definitely come here by road, the recommended way to reach this place is by the metro. Kaushambhi Metro Station on the Blue Line is the closest metro station, situated at a distance of 2km from the place. You can easily get an e-rickshaw or auto from there. Timings: 3am &#x2013; 7pm.

The trek is famous for its natural formed lake from the melted snow of Dauladhar peaks.(as mentioned by our guide)The trek, also act as a starting/ mid point to one other trek known as Milkani Pass reaching another district (Chamba) just by climbing mountains.Yes the trek seems to bit difficult as it is pretty steep and should definitely be avoided during monsoons.Well coming to my itenary it was a pretty short one can be covered during weekend as well, so here it goes.We reached dharamshala by 8:30 in the morning from Delhi.Try to make an overnight journey for far places to avoid tiredness. From dharamshala you can either take shared cabs directly to Kareri Village (400-700 per person negotiable) or you can take loca bus from bus stand to Ghera Village and can opt for sharing cabs. The way is pretty scary though.We reached our destination by 10ish, due to the damaged roads.We pre- booked our camps from delhi itself so we were supposed to be meeting our Guide /coordinator their. We had breakfast and started our trek by 11. The trek, its not an easy one but I would like to rate it somewhere between Moderate- Difficult, due to its steepness &amp; non-defined paths.We reached the place by 6 (depends on your pace) and the trek I don&#x2019;t even think its 13 kms , from where we started, its should be close to 15/16kms. Before even starting the trek we got our energy drained out.Ok but the best part is , you will be drained out but with passing path you can witness some jaw dropping view which is definetly gonna rejuvinate you.So we reached around5:30 or 6:00 in the evening witnessed another mesmerising calm view. Floating Clouds, misty weather, drizzling and just you. Yes you will be hearing people, from your neighbouring tent, but when I just sat there on that rock in the centre all voices just faded away, it was just me and the view and I could go on sitting there. Our camps were already set there, we ate our dinner had bonfire while enjoying the most scenic sky, like the one I always wanted to see since my childhood. The starry sky was so beautiful,they seems to be so huge and close, to be honest havent seen such a beauty till now. We started 8 in the morning for kareri village and reached around 1. It will take more time to come back as to trek to the lake point. Since we had our buses booked, so we were forced to return back from where it all started. My journey may end here but I guess a part of me is left in those mountains, as I still picture me being there.To be honest I was AWED by that place.",

With the dazzling turquoise waters surrounding specks of emerald green islands, Maldives is definitely a paradise for the beach bummers. This incredible destination boasts of postcard-perfect beaches with crystalline white sand, pristine coral reefs and some of the most amazing marine life. Located southwest of India and Sri Lanka amidst the great expanse of the Indian Ocean, Maldives is an archipelago of more than 1000 islands and over another thousand reefs. Only about 200 islands are inhabited. Tourism is one of the most important sources of income here and about 80 islands have luxurious tourist resorts dedicated only for attracting tourism.Maldives is one of the most sought after destinations for luxury travellers as well as honeymooners for the beauty and serenity it has to offer. A paradise for the travellers, Maldives had been always said to be expensive. But with changes in the law allowing the locals to open guesthouses on private islands, making the place affordable for the budget travellers as well. So, if you are planning to visit Maldives, it is not required to spend a fortune on the trip. Follow this DIY 7-days itinerary for Maldives to enjoy this stunning archipelago without burning a hole in your pocket.\nDay 1HulhumaléHotelsMapDay 1: HulhumaleAfter your arrival at Maldives, the first day should be spent at Hulhumale Island. This is one of the islands that can be visited by road. Usually, you have to take a private or public ferry or seaplane to hop on to an island. There are a number of budget as well as luxury hotels at Hulhumale Island. Two wheelers are quite common here and you can rent one to explore Hulhumale. The island has a beautiful beach that you can explore at your own leisure.Day 2MaafushiHotelsMapDay 2: Hulhumale &#x2013; Male &#x2013; MaafushiYou have to go to the Hulhumale port to board a local boat for Male city. The local boats at Hulhumale depart every 30 minutes. Take any of the boats and arrive at Male. Roam about Male, visit the largest mosque in Male and then visit the Villingili Ferry Terminal for onward journey towards Maafushi. Arrive at Villingili port with some time in hand. The Villingili Beach is within walking distance from the port. Take the 3 PM boat that leaves towards Maafushi. It takes around 2 hours to reach Maafushi and while on the way, enjoy the awesome views.Maafushi is one of the largest islands in Maldives located 27 km from Male. There are a number of accommodation options here to choose from.Day 3MaafushiHotelsMapDay 3: Exploring MaafushiMaafushi is an idyllic place with plenty of beautiful beaches, water activities and some great food. There are a number of things that you can do at Maafushi.Explore the beachesThere are four main beaches &#x2013; Public Beach, Bikini Beach, Water Sports Beach and Coral Beach. As the name suggests, Bikini beach is the only beach here where you can roam around in skimpy swimwear (bikinis for ladies and topless for men). It is illegal to expose your skin in public on other parts of the island. Bikini Beach is usually quite crowded. There are two Public Beaches and they are usually quieter and less crowded.Water activities &#x2013; Snorkeling and DivingMaldives is a heaven for under water marine life. You can book snorkelling and diving tours at the local diving centres to explore the aquatic life here. Maavelaathu, Banana Reef, Vilivaru Corner, Maafushi Corner are the main snorkeling points. Scuba Diving at Maldives is an unforgettable experience. There are 3 diving centers on Maafushi and it costs $35 per dive. Among other water sports, you can enjoy parasailing, jet ski or embark on a fascinating kayak trip.SandbankVisit the sandbank in the midst of crystalline turquoise water. Enjoy sitting in the pristine white sand while enjoying the gorgeous views of the sea.Courtesy: WikimediaDolphin SafariThis is something that you should not miss. It will be wonderful sight to see the school of dolphins gracefully playing in the waters. Spotting of dolphins is always a matter of chance, but if you spot the dolphins, it is going to be a surreal experience.Day 4FihalholiHotelsMapDay 4: Maafushi &#x2013; FihalhohiTo reach Fihalhohi, you have to take a speedboat. Fihalhohi is the last island of South Male and is the place for overwater bungalows that Maldives is so famous for. The place has a captivating view of the Indian Ocean and is truly a tropical paradise. The beach resorts are equally charming with palm-thatched roofs and a private terrace overlooking the island&#x2019;s terrain. This is a place where you simply need to forget everything and relax. Indulge yourself in an exotic spa treatment as well.Day 5: Back to MaafushiReturn to Maafushi from Fihalhohi and this day, take your time to explore the place, Visit the souvenir shops. It is advisable to buy the souvenirs from here as they are cheaper compared to other islands.Day 6: Maafushi &#x2013; FulidhooAnother island paradise of Maldives, Fulidhoo is a tiny island, just 675 metres by 200 metres. You can reach here by speedboat or by public ferry. Public ferries run from Male to Fulidhoo stopping at Maafushi in between. The main beach here is simply gorgeous. You can also indulge in snorkeling, diving and kayaking in the lagoon here. There are a number of guest houses at this island for accommodation.Day 7: Fulidhoo &#x2013; MaleMale is the capital city of Maldives. I always feel that a culture of a country can be properly understood by exploring its capital city. After you arrive at Male from Maafushi, keep the day for exploring this crowded capital. There are no mandatory attractions as such in Male. You can visit the Sultan&#x2019;s Park, The President&apos;s palace, Mulee Aage and the National Museum. If you had not visited the mosque on Day 2, it is the time to visit it now.Courtesy: WikimediaThere are several cosmopolitan dining at Male having international and Indian fare. You can stay at Male itself. The Somerset Hotel, Hotel Jen Male and Hotel Octave are some options that you can look into.Day 8: Depart from MaleSome important Tips for your Maldives Trip&#x2022;\tWhen in mainland Male, dress appropriately. Maldives is an Islamic country and so certain dresses are not allowed unless you are in an exclusive resort. Respect the traditions and culture of the country you visit.&#x2022;\tCost can be greatly reduced if you do not stay in an exclusive resort. You can stay in Maafushi instead and have a day-excursion to an exclusive resort. You can save up to 500$ in this way.&#x2022;\tDo not lose the receipt when you will be exchanging your USD to MVR. You will need it in case you want the leftover local currency be changed back to USD.&#x2022;\tIf possible, experience the signature overwater bungalow accommodation. It is pricey, but completely worth it.&#x2022;\tAlcohol is not usually available in the local islands.&#x2022;\tVisa-on-arrival is available for all nationalities.&#x2022;\tExplore Maldives in comfortable dress and shoes with good sun-protection.",

		"Text": "Today&apos;s post is one of my most desirable content ever, I am writing this to share with you my idea for a perfect Vacation. I had been to Mauritius last Summer with my husband and I had the most beautifully amazing vacation there which also included a short stay in Seychelles. But that&apos;ll be discussed in further posts. Mauritius is one of the world&apos;s top luxury tourism destinations.It possesses a wide range of natural and human-made attractions, enjoys a tropical climate with clear warm sea waters, attractive beaches, tropical fauna and flora complemented by a multi-ethnic and cultural population. These tourism assets are its main strength, especially since they are backed up by well-designed and run hotels, and reliable and operational services and infrastructures. Mauritius received the World Leading Island Destination award for the third time and World&apos;s Best Beach at the World Travel Awards in January 2012. There&apos;s Something About Mauritius ! \n\nIts an Island in the Indian Ocean about 2000 kilometers off the southeast coast of the African continent. The people of Mauritius are multiethnic, multi-religious, multicultural and multilingual. The island&apos;s government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, and Mauritius is highly ranked for democracy and for economic and political freedom. Along with the other Mascarene Islands, Mauritius is known for its varied flora and fauna, with many species endemic to the island. The island is widely known as the only known home of the dodo, which, along with several other avian species, was made extinct by human activities relatively shortly after the island&apos;s settlement.\n\n\nIt was a six nights and seven days package, We boarded an International flight (Ethiad Airways) from Mumbai airport and after two connecting flights we reached to Mauritius International Airport, where we were assisted to Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita Coastal Road Beau Champ. After arrival rest of the day was a leisure time to explore this beautiful city on our own. The sparkling crystal in the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean was fascinating. The contrast of colors, cultures and tastes makes the Island so charming that the scene is set for an unforgettable holiday. After exploring a bit of it on our own was so much fun soothing. We ended our day with a delicious Seafood Cuisine. \n\nAfter breakfast we proceeded to explore the northern regime of the island where we were assisted by a guide and a car for transport, visited Fort Adelaise - Citadel, Round of champ de Mars, Marie Reine de la paix, Mall of Mauritius - Bagatelle and Caudan waterfront, Shopping complex and lastly to a craft market. In the middle of our journey we also enjoyed the delicacies of food famous in Mauritius.\n\n\nAfter a lavish breakfast we moved on to a south island tour to La Vallee des Couleurs Nature Park, for a full day tour of exotic Southern region of island. Visited floreal shopping complex, famous Volcanic crater - Trou Aux Cerfs It was the most amazing view I&apos;ve ever seen in my life. Next was a Grand Bassin Shiv Temples and Visited to LA Vallee des Couleurs Nature Park. It was a hectic day but we enjoyed to the core and ended up collecting lot of beautiful and unforgettable memories.\n\n\nThere was excitement every single day to explore this beautiful island. After breakfast we proceeded to lle Aux Cerf Island, There we experienced a thrilling speed boat ride across to the island, revealing the beauty of fine white sand and crystal clear blue waters. The rest of the time was given us leisure and explore the various water sports activities. It was again a beautiful day spent and the most special part of that day was the food that was available on the island. It was a deliciously fried lobster with loads of salad and dressings.\n\n\nOn this day after breakfast we headed to the capital city of Mauritius, Port Louis is the country&apos;s economic, cultural, political centre and most populous city. I was so impressed with the structures and the ambiance of the local restaurants. Streets of the market were so well maintained and decorated, It was all adorable and unforgettable. Port Louis is also good to explore varieties of food available. I also shopped a lot from the locals which included varieties of fruits, perfumes, pair of footwear and also colorful shades. They were super cheap and affordable.\n\n\nFor people like us who just love water sports couldn&apos;t get enough in just one day so we decided to go and explore every single water sport available there. After having an Italian breakfast we headed to our water sport routine where I went crazy about Kitesurfing, Parasailing, Under water walk, Scuba diving, Speed boat ride, Banana boat ride and last but not the least our Submarine ride which was just amazing. I had never experienced something like that before, So it was all totally a new experience that just felt wow ! Though there were few very expensives rides like Submarine, scuba diving, Under water walk which almost costed a lac for a couple but trust me, It was worth.\nAs it was our last day in Mauritius we had to just go and shop, we headed to Port Louis market again and this time we got all the antiques available there like sand work in a glass bottle, dresses that were handcrafted and again lots of fruits :p It was a wonderful wrap with such beautiful memories and experiences.\n\nIf you prefer balmy weather and lukewarm ocean water, like we do, I suggest visiting in their summer (November to May). The wind is also calmer during the summer, which will provide those glassy ocean conditions which are perfect for surfing, SUP and kayaking. However, if you like mild temperatures or any water sport that requires wind, such as kitesurfing, then winter is the time to visit.\nSo after travelling for a couple of years, we&apos;ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation. Yatra.com is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights. It searches for the best fare and includes both standard and budget airlines. The price calendar feature shows the cheapest days to fly in your preferred month of travel. \nThank you for stopping by and reading my guide to Mauritius, I hope it help you to decide your dream vacation or holidays. For more travel blogs, stay tuned and keep visiting.",

		"Text": "#Just Google : Inside Out with Rahul Yuvi #It&#x2019;s about the journey, the story of which should have been told 6.5 years ago, a time when I weighed just 48 Kgs (yes you read it right, 48 kgs) and Nishtha had just completed her bachelors..As we just commenced a new innings of life , we chose Kerala-God&#x2019;s Own Country &#x2013; for our first trip together.Before this trip ,wanderlust was yet to bite me and I was rather a reluctant and anxious traveler who used to make long list of things to carry before travel and then recheck smallest of stuff before leaving the Hotel room. How both of us got obsessed with travel after Kerala trip is more than evident from our Facebook profile and travel blogs that I have published so far.The Journey :\nDay 1CochinHotelsMapAs we landed at Cochin Airport , we were quiet expectedly greeted by hot &amp; humid weather, forcing us to take off our heavy Jackets which were in line with chilled December winters of Delhi from where we took off.While being driven from Cochin to Munnar , I was little tense since it was our first trip together and I really wanted everything to fall in place perfectly without any hiccups.. So I was somewhat anxious about everything &#x2013; food , Hotels ,sightseeing spots etc. &#x2013; that whether they all will actually be as good &amp; great as I had planned or not . Two hours into the drive and we decided to have lunch .But , as the destiny would have it , our first dine stop didn&#x2019;t turn out as good as one would wish to. Firstly , taste of the food was pretty average and to add to our woes , there was very strong smell of fish / meat all around.Being Vegetarian and addicted to the typical spicy north Indian food resulted in uneasiness for both of us .Anyways , we somehow managed and left the place with my heart little heavier with the guilt that oh, our first dining experience on the tour , which should have been exotic &amp; excellent, was anything but great. { Still only 10 days of marriage so I wanted to make an impression of being the best husband in the world }But all my apprehensions came to a halt as we reached our resort at Munnar .Excellent Locations, beautiful ambiance and wonderful room.MunnarHotelsMapMunnar is a beautiful hill station located in the Idukki district of Kerala.It is called &#x2018;Kashmir of South India&#x2019; because of it&#x2019;s scenic resemblance to Kashmir .There was a local market nearby to our resort, where we used to take long strolls and enjoy local delicacies every evening. But there&#x2019;s a particular instance that happened in Munnar which needs a special mention :Day 2Carmelagiri Elephant ParkHotelsMapElephant ride : The Untold Story #1It looked a mere child&#x2019;s play to have an elephant ride to both of us until Mr. Elephant started throwing tantrums &amp; refused to return to the start point with both of us over his back. Nishtha looked at me with scary eyes .While I tried my level best to put my brave foot forward in front of my newly found friend for life, unfortunately, odd sounds made by the Biggie forced me to yell to the mahout , &#x201D; bhaiya bachao , bhaiya bachao &#x201D; (Please save us bro !).The Mahout looked at us with amused eyes , I am not sure whether he even understood Hindi language but yes ,he did help us. With a rather embarrassing show in the time of distress , I kept quiet and tried to avoid any conversation with her for the rest of the day, which otherwise I was planning to spend in telling Nishtha my Childhood stories of courage :PPhotographs below will give a glimpse of a few other sightseeing spots we visited around Munnar.IruttukanamHotelsMapMattupetty DamHotelsMapDay 3KumarakomHotelsMapKayal Resort &#x2013; The Untold story # 2 &#x2013; Before I spill the beans on our next story , please have a look at clicks below which will give you an idea of how wonderful and extravagant our resort at Kumarakom was :Ok , so photographs done, now coming back to the real turn up of events &#x2013; We reached Kayal resort , Kumarakom from Munnar at around 7 :30 pm .As we were being driven to the resort , there was total darkness backed by pin drop silence on the roads with rural ambiance all around .I got little disappointed as I threw my expectations out of window for what kind of resort would be there in the vicinity of such an area .Fortunately, I was wrong as Kayal Resort turned out to be superb , with lightening around pool making it look even better. But &#x2013; Story abi baaki hai mere dost (real story is yet to unfold) &#x2013; As we were seeping in the feeling of staying in a super neatly done suite ,situated amidst clear blue waters , we were told that we were the only guests in the resort that night .Yes, we would have certainly liked our privacy but such a huge resort with hardly 2-3 staff people around ,those too unknown at an unknown place far from the city, was certainly not something we asked for .For the first few minutes into the room , we kept saying ,&#x201D;Mast resort hai yar &#x201D; (Resort is good) but then a sudden sound of somebody whistling loud followed by some other guy shouting made sure that we spent the entire Night happily &#x2013; with our eyes wide open &amp; every possible light in the room on (including those of Toilets) :)..Resort in itself was however truly superb !But hey, it&#x2019;s not that we have only scary stories to recall from kerala, no no, kerala is too beautiful a state to have not impressed whosoever visits it.Let&#x2019;s move towards some delightful memories from hereon .Day 4AlleppeyHotelsMapHouse Boat experience with a mandatory overnight stay is probably the best thing that can happen to you in Kerala. Enjoying hot &amp; sizzling food, prepared live in front of you while your house boat runs you through greenery &amp; backwaters of Kerala, is truly a mesmerizing experience .Here are a few pics to share :Day 5KovalamHotelsMapAh ! Who can forget the ever famous Kovalam beaches where we had so much fun for two back to back days. We stayed at the Uday Samudra which proved to be a good choice ,thanks to the beaches in the immediate vicinity .The sound of sea waves dancing in the night and water touching your feet as you enjoy sea side candle light dinner makes you go ecstatic .Day 7KanyakumariHotelsMapWe took a short trip from Kovalam to Kanyakumari on our penultimate day in Kerala where our primary stop was at Vivekanand Rock Memorial . Please don&#x2019;t judge the pic as my facial expressions in the pic are totally contradictory to my happy mood then. {I don&#x2019;t know what forced me to give such bad expressions &#x2013; strong winds may be or the sun with it&#x2019;s full throttle on or..I really don&#x2019;t know :O }Day 8Time now to say goodbye as we have reached the last day of this travel narration when we headed back to New Delhi from Thrivanathpuram Airport but hey wait ! After having gone through some of my earlier personal blogs, you all must be very wondering how come Nishtha didn&#x2019;t shop on this trip.Well she did : Kasavu Sarees !! ( Swear on my god I heard this term Kasavu for the first time there at Kovalam )As for the Kerala , goes without saying &#x2013; a must visit destination for sure !!&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;New DelhiHotelsMapClearly, none of us is 48 kgs anymore ! :)I hope you enjoyed our first journey together !&#xA0; Would love to hear your feedback in the comments below or simply google Inside Out with Rahul Yuvi.You can also visit me here :https://insideoutwithrahulyuvi.com/https://www.facebook.com/Passport.Souls/or watch my latest EuroTrip videos here :https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN3swgm0VhdADMWGewSsKJANamaste &amp; take care !",

Think oceans, seafood and cultural heritage &#x2013; think Kanyakumari!We travelled from Mysuru during July and it turned out to be the perfect time to visit the place. Sultry days and pleasant evenings are quite common in Kanyakumari.We stayed in Nagercoil and rented a two-wheeler for our transport purposes.Here are the top 5 highlights of Kanyakumari/Nagercoil.1.\tDrive from Kanyakumari to NagercoilThe sunrise at Kanyakumari is world-famous (I couldn&#x2019;t enjoy it completely! More of that later). As our hotel was located in Nagercoil ( a mere 20 minute drive), we had to drive down to Kanyakumari at 4 am in the morning. The roads were empty and the cold morning breeze whipped against our faces. As we reached the Vivekananda Rock, the whole place was teeming with tourists. I lost the whole essence of the sunrise as all I could hear was a babble of noises and random people taking selfies.I have an interesting alternative to the sunrise! More on that later!2.\tHave Panamkalkandu milk and Sukku CoffeeCoffee shops in Nagercoil serve some interesting and authentic dishes such as Panamkalkandu (palm jaggery) milk and Sukku (dry ginger) coffee which are mind-blowingly awesome! Please do ask for these and give them a try.3.\tVisit less-known beaches and heritage sitesThe common and famous ones are obviously filled with tourists. There are some lesser known beaches such as Sangudurai and Mottam beaches. The famous Padmanabhapuram palace is also nearby and the drive uptil there is very tranquil.Mottam Beach, KanyakumariPlease do go through the points I&#x2019;ve listed at the end of the blog carefully. 4.\tHave FishThis is an obvious one but I&#x2019;m mentioning it for the sheer taste of fish and prawns that place offers. I&#x2019;ve had fish from almost all parts of the country but this had a truly authentic taste along with the mind-blowingly cheap prices.5.\tSunset as opposed to sunriseThis is in continuation to point number 1 where I had lamented about the crowd of babbling tourists who ruin the whole essence of a world-famous sunrise. Instead, I suggest you visit the same place in the evenings to experience the serenity of the place. You might not get a picturesque view but the experience of having a quiet evening along with your loved ones at the tip of this great nation is unparalleled and no scenery in the world can replace it.IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE:i.\tPlease take care of your safety at these beaches. None of them are suitable for bathing or a dip. All you can do is stand at a distance and appreciate its beauty. NEVER EVER attempt to touch the water. Avoid too many selfies near the treacherous rocks.ii.\tPrefer renting a two-wheeler as the town isn&#x2019;t known for many public transport facilities.",

		"Text": "KenyaHotelsMapWelcome to Kenya, the greatest wildlife watching destination on earth.It is hard to choose my favourite wildlife encounter in Kenya. Most of the time, I zero down on the Wildebeest Migration I witnessed the greatest natural spectacle on earth. Then suddenly, my mind sways to picture perfect view at Amboseli National Park; herds of African Elephants (easily in 100s) with a spectacular backdrop of the snowy peak of Africa&#x2019;s highest Mt. Kilimanjaro. At that moment, I remember how sailing in a wooden boat right next to mighty hippos in Lake Naivasha sent shivers down my spine. You know what? I give up. I loved every single bit of Kenya!How to planAn ideal itinerary in Kenya should let you explore and appreciate the diversity in wildlife here. So, if your next holiday destination is Kenya, look no further, research no more, just read below for the ultimate safari fix.Nairobi (2 Nights) &#x2013; for unique animal encounters, shopping and nightlife Masai Mara (2 Nights) &#x2013; for the wildebeest migration and the &#x2018;BIG 5&#x2019;Naivasha (2 Nights) &#x2013; for cycling amidst zebras and giraffes and sailing with hipposNakuru (1 Night)&#x2013; for chasing the elusive black rhinos(1 KES = 0.7 INR)Day 1NairobiHotelsMapDay 1: NairobiIn spite of being a metropolis with a not-to-miss nightlife scene, Nairobi, to the surprise of many has wildlife experiences not found anywhere else in the country.David Sheldrick Elephant &amp; Rhino OrphanageHotelsMapStart your day at David Shedrick Elephant Orphanage (opens daily from 11 to 12, Entry: KES 500) to see the baby elephants being fed by giant milk bottles and know more about their conservation.Giraffe CentreHotelsMapThe Giraffe Centre (Entry KES 1000) next door lets you get &#x2018;close&#x2019; to the endangered Rothschild giraffes. Feed them, caress them, hug them but make sure you have their feed in your hands or get ready for a headbutt. Look for Ed, he is the tallest and the friendliest of them all.If you are in the mood for some history, head to the Nairobi National Museum which has some excellent cultural and natural-history exhibits. Those in love of our reptile friends must visit the Snake Park in the same campus.Carnivore KenyaHotelsMapEating at the Carnivore restaurant is an experience you cannot miss! Apart from pork, chicken and turkey, they also serve exotic crocodile and ostrich meat. Take their all-you-can-eat buffet at KES 3600 for a culinary experience to remember. My, oh, my, I never knew the ostrich was so tasty and the croc so soft!It might come as a surprise, but Nairobi is the party capital of East Africa and the Westlands suburbs is the place to be to experience the nightlife of the city.Brew Bistro Rooftop Westlands Fortis TowerHotelsMapHead to the rooftop bar Brew Bistro and Lounge after dark for some good views, great music and dancingibis Styles Hotel Westlands NairobiHotelsMapStay: Choose Ibis Styles, located in the posh and safe Westlands area. At KES 7,000, the rooms are functional, a sumptuous breakfast is included and it offers excellent value for money. Their rooftop lounge is the place to be in the city for an evening coffee/beer. Tip: Avoid walking after 7 pm in Nairobi. Take Uber / Taxify, it is cheap and everywhere.Day 2Amboseli National ParkHotelsMapDay 2: Nairobi &gt; Amboseli &gt; NairobiThe Amboseli National Park is honestly, in the middle of nowhere! Despite its location, it is a game park not to be missed and is totally worth the 250km drive from Nairobi. Start early from Nairobi to make the most of the 24-hour entry permit to the park.I can go on record and say that, nowhere else in Kenya can you see so many wild elephants in a single frame as in Amboseli. The magnificent views of the mighty Kilimanjaro at the back is simply a cherry on the top.Park entry at $60 / person. Think it is a bit over the top? Brace yourself for some pricey adventures coming your way.Stay: Ibis Styles, WestlandsDay 3Maasai Mara National ReserveHotelsMapDay 3: Nairobi &gt; Maasai MaraThere is no better time to visit the Maasai Mara National Reserve than between end-July and August. This is when millions of wildebeests and zebras migrate to the grasslands in Kenya from Tanzania in search of greener pastures.The Great Migration- one of the Seven New Wonders of the WorldOther than that, Maasai Mara is one of the best reserves to spot the African Big 5 (Elephant, Lion, Leopard, Buffalo and Rhino) all year round.The drive to the reserve takes about 6 hours from Nairobi. We spent the rest of our evening chilling by the campfire, chit-chatting with the Maasai people and prepping up for the full day safari the next day.Oldarpoi Mara CampHotelsMapStay: Prices tend to get very steep during the high season here. We chose a Maasai community run camp called Oldarpoi (KES 5,600 /person/night including all 3 meals).Since the camp was outside the gate, we avoided paying the park entry ($80 / person) twice for a 2- night stay and just had to pay once for our full day safari.Tip: Book your stay first and then negotiate a safari package with the camp. We got a sweet deal of a full day safari (6 am to 6 pm) at our camp for $210 (for the entire vehicle). This really helped us save tons of money from the tour companies who quoted us ridiculously high rates. Day 4Maasai Mara National ReserveHotelsMapDay 4: Maasai MaraAn early breakfast, a packed lunch and you are all set for a day in the wild.As I was saying, Once the wildebeests are here in the Maasai Mara, their most challenging test is crossing the shallow and tiny Mara river. This is when the scene got the most dramatic and wild.Wildebeests waiting to cross the Mara RiverA Lioness waiting in the bush ready to attach the vulnerable WildebeestsWe could see the crocodiles patiently waiting and the lion hiding in the bushes. And a herd of wildebeest approach, there were at least 10,000 of them if not more. The first one comes down to the river and hesitate, they all hesitate. The first one takes a leap of faith and crosses, they all cross.Many cross, some slip and a few get hunted. We saw a kill, not one but four. The lion got his prey when the wildebeests are the most vulnerable.We had an extraordinary day at the reserve, so out of the ordinary that even the guide said that we have been very lucky and that such luck does not come very often. Apart from the front seat view of the drama at river crossings, we saw a lion couple honeymooning, a pride of 20+ lioness, a young leopard dragging its prey up a tree and 3 cheetahs lazing around the bush.A young leopard in the wild- such a shy animal that it&#x27;s the very difficult to spot it3 Cheetahs sunbathing in the Savannah grasslands- the fastest animal on earthIt just doesn&#x2019;t get any better!Stay: Oldarpoi Mara CampDay 5NaivashaHotelsMapDay 5: Masai Mara &gt; NaivashaThe Maasai are the indigenous tribe who call this part of Kenya their home. Visit a Maasai village in the morning to understand their ways of living which are still deeply rooted in tradition. Dance with the men and women as they welcome you. Explore one of the village houses, learn how the Maasai make fire and appreciate their deep dependence on cattle for their livelihood.At the Maasai Village at Maasai MaraTip: Instead of booking the village walk through the camp, we went and talked to the village chief on our own. He was happy to welcome us at KES 2000 instead of KES 6000 which the camp had quoted us.An hour before sunset is a mesmerising time to be in the lake and on a boat. We reached Naivasha and headed straight to the Lake Naivasha. Head to the Karagita public beach and pay no more than KES 1500 for the entire boat for an hour.While there is some excellent bird watching opportunities around the lake, the main highlight for me was getting closer to the hippos. It is exciting and scary at the same time. We just prayed and hoped that there is no hippo below our boat!Can you spot the Hippo?Stay: Jane&#x2019;s Guest House in Naivasha is a lovely B&amp;B at a great price (KES 6000 / night). Their breakfast is the best we had in Kenya and the chef is happy to oblige you with veggie dishes during lunch and dinner.Day 6Hell&#x27;s Gate National ParkHotelsMapDay 6: Naivasha &gt; Hell&#x2019;s Gate National Park &gt; NaivashaHell&#x2019;s Gate is the only national park in the world which permits cycling and walking amidst the wild animals. While there are no predatory animals in the park, it is an absolute treat cycling with the zebras, giraffes and warthogs. You could see an occasional wild buffalo as well and might want to cycle a little faster then.The park&#x2019;s landscape is entirely volcanic and a trek through the gorge till the Devil&#x2019;s bedroom is a must for adrenaline seekers. The hot geysers along the way and the unique volcanic rock formations kept us engaged during the trek.Park entry is $26 / person while the bicycle can be rented at KES 600 / entire day. We vehemently insist you take a guide for your trek up the gorge (KES 1300 / 2 hours trek to the devil&#x2019;s bedroom)Stay: Jane&#x2019;s Guest House, NaivashaDay 7NakuruHotelsMapDay 7: Naivasha &gt; Nakuru / BogoriaYou have a choice here. Either chase rhinos in Lake Nakuru (2 hours drive from Naivasha) or drive up further north to see the pink flamingoes at Lake Bogoria. We made our choice and honestly, it was really not the right one.The drive to Bogoria is long (3 hours from Nakuru/5 hours from Naivasha) and the roads are bad. Bonus- we crossed the Equator!Rising water level has nearly submerged all the roads inside the park as well. There might be a million pink flamingoes there but a majority of them are at the inaccessible part of the lake. We still saw a very large herd right at the entrance. Lake Bogoria- Where Pink Flamingoes ruleIt was fascinating but I wonder if it was worth the drive and the pain!Lake Nakuru National Park, on the other hand, houses the elusive black rhinos of Kenya. It also was home to a million flamingoes but they all fled to Bogoria due to rising water levels. If you have missed the rhino at Maasai Mara (there are very very few of them there) Nakuru is your best bet to finally see all of the Big 5.Eastmark HotelHotelsMapStay: Eastmark Hotel offers recently built, large and modern rooms at KES 7000 / nightDay 8NairobiHotelsMapDay 8: Nakuru &gt; Nairobi (3 hours Drive)There it still something important pending before your Kenyan experience is complete; shopping for African handicrafts.City MarketHotelsMapThe City Market has a range of shops selling every Kenyan handicraft under the sun. Must buys are the typical red chequered Maasai blanket, the sisal bags, the Maasai shield and various wooden statues and goodies (we bought a small wooden giraffe statue and loads of key rings and magnets).African Curios - Happily bought and now on my Ibis Bed :)Just put your bargaining hat on and hold on to it. There isn&#x2019;t a better time to make full use of your generous baggage allowance Kenya Airways is offering these days.Stay: Ibis Styles Westlands / Flight back homeHow to execute the planVISA: Kenya offers Visa on Arrival for Indians. Just flash a $50 note in exchange for a super quick single entry visa. You can also apply online on http://evisa.go.ke/evisa.htmlYELLOW FEVER: India needs your YFV and Polio vaccine certificates once you are back home. Make sure you take both a month before your travelTRANSPORT: Rent a car with a driver here for intercity travel &#x2013; it is cheap and the most convenient. With Uber only in Nairobi, we would not recommend struggling with your luggage on the Matatus (local buses)STAY: Once again, the award for the best online hotel booking website goes to Booking.comWhat happens after the planFor starters, you stop feeling jealous of the Discovery people. Finally, you get to see what they see and film; this time not on an HD screen but in person.Secondly, your home gets a makeover, it is hard to resist the temptation of buying African crafts.At last but certainly not the least, you come back with unforgettable African safari memories worthy enough to be passed from one generation to the next.",

		"Text": "Source: HindustanTimesIt is a general belief that beaches are for summers, but have you been to a beach in the monsoon season? It is beautiful. With wind in your hair and sand beneath, witness the sky changing colours as if mood swings. When all things pretty and picture-perfect, then why not show off your photography skills to get some Instagrammable pictures of the season on these beaches. Adding cherry to the cake is the availability of good accommodation at cheap rates because of the offseason.\nPromenade BeachHotelsMapLined along the stretch of Bay of Bengal, Promenade beach in Puducherry is a treat to one&apos;s eyes and soul. Puducherry is itself a popular beach destination in South India and the beaches turns into magic during the monsoon season. The rains also make the temperature drop thus making the weather much comfortable to explore the place.  \tVagator BeachHotelsMapVagator beach is considered to be one of the most beautiful and happening beaches of Goa. Since monsoon is generally the off season, you can have the pristine beach to yourself and enjoy your beach days to the fullest. Ten minutes away from the beach is the famous Chapara Fort which gives a stunning view from the top. When in Goa during the monsoon season, don&apos;t miss the Dudhsagar Falls, which is at its best during the season.  \tKudle Beach RoadHotelsMapWith the Arabian Sea on one side and the Western Ghats on other, Kudle Beach in Gokarna is a scenic destination that should not be missed in any season. Though water sports activities are not available through this season, monsoon still has its own charm here; changing colour of the sky, cool weather and long stretches of beaches with almost no tourists around. Travellers can come and enjoy their early morning walks or yoga sessions.  \tVelneshwar BeachHotelsMapVelneshwar Beach is one of the many hidden gems in Maharashtra. A secluded beach destination along the Konkan coast that gets picture perfect in the monsoon season, is just perfect for a weekend getaway. With dark clouds hovering over the vast stretch of sea, gently swaying palm trees and clean shorelines, Velneshwar is a must visit in monsoon. The smooth sea water makes it easier for swimmers to enjoy the beaches. One can also visit the Velneshwar Temple nearby if there is extra time.  \tQuerim BeachHotelsMapLocated in North Goa, Querim beach is among the few pristine beaches of Goa that are not crowded. An uncommercialised beach with few shacks here and there for continuous food supply is just what you need after months of hard work. Kick back and relax on this beach, when you feel tired of all the pulsating nightlife in Goa. With few rocks on the shoreline and waves passing through them, the place becomes picturesque during monsoon season.  \tVarkala BeachHotelsMapKerala is pretty during the rainy season, but Varkala Beach becomes much attractive. A beach with cliffs alongside the Arabian Sea is worth a visit and definitely is photogenic. Apart from the white sand beaches, there are several nearby attraction like Janardana Swami Temple and Sivagiri Mutt, to explore. The water sports activities might not be available for travellers during the monsoon period, but the weather and limited crowd makes up for everything.  \tPalolem BeachHotelsMapA clean crescent-shaped beach white sand beach along with swaying coconut trees in the area is what Palolem Beach in South Goa is all about. Mostly inhabited by fishermen, the beach is relatively less crowded and one can get cheaper accommodation during monsoon. Get to know the lifestyle of these fishermen or get yourself an ayurvedic massage on the beach, Palolem Beach has something to offer to all its visitors in all the seasons.  \tVisit these beaches to experience the best of rainy season. For all the mountain people out there, please don&apos;t take any adventurous expedition to the mountain during monsoon season, it is not safe. Try beaches instead, it might even convert you into a beach person!Have you already been to any of the above mentioned beaches during the monsoon? Share your experience with us here.

		"Text": "EgyptHotelsMapEgypt &#x2013; Stepping into the Land of Pharaohs and Pyramids.Ancient Egyptians have done humanity a favour. As one of the worlds first civilisations, their advancement in architecture, science, astronomy, and medicine continues to intrigue humans till today and has served as a foundation for the developed society we have today.Above all, I think they have done a bigger favour to the present day Egypt. Amidst all the haggling, the chaos and the touts, our only driving force to keep going forward was our fascination with the pharaonic period. As we delved deeper, and as we moved down south to upper Egypt; our curiosity only intensified and we eventually learned to ignore the negatives around.Picture a mountaineer who has just scaled the summit, she had been preparing for months. Now, picture us below:This was our moment; months of preparation and research finally led us to the tomb of the boy king, King Tut. The treasures found in his tomb adorn majority of the rooms in the Cairo museum and whose tomb discovered in 1922 is till date the only untouched tomb of a pharaoh ever found. Visiting his final resting place was a glorious end to stories we had been reading and hearing. This was undoubtedly the pinnacle of our Egyptian adventure.Our itineraryUsually when I write about itineraries, I layout the places we had been, the eateries we ate and the hotels we stayed in. I am going to deviate a bit, just this time. As I sit here waiting for my flight to Nairobi and thinking about the past two weeks here, I think, I am in a position to advise you to avoid the mistakes we made and enjoy our highs a little more than we did.Egypt needs at-least 1 week&#x2022;\tSpend 2 nights in Cairo admiring the pyramids and getting lost in the National Museum. &#x2022;\tTake a short flight to Aswan and directly get onboard on your Nile cruise (3 nights). Do not take either the night or the day train from Cairo; the journey is arduous and extremely tiring. &#x2022;\tAs your Nile cruise leisurely sails its way up to Luxor, it will give you enough time to explore the Edfu and Kombo Ombo temples that come along the way. &#x2022;\tOnce in Luxor, take a private transfer to Hurghada. Enjoy the best snorkeling, diving and just the tranquil red sea for 2 nights before heading back to Cairo. &#x2022;\tThis sums to around 7 nights &#x2013; 8 days, perfect for a Saturday to Sunday break! Cairo (2 Nights )Must see:Egyptian MuseumHotelsMap&#x2022;\tEgyptian Museum: With the largest collection of Egyptian artefacts in the world, this place is a pharaonic treasure chest. For us, the highlight was the Mummies room and The treasures of Tutankhamun room, so much so that we visited these rooms again on our way out of Egypt.The Pyramids Of GizaHotelsMap&#x2022;\tThe Great Pyramids of Giza: How the hell did these guys do it? A question which boggled our minds, the first time we saw these larger-than-life structures. We spent hours and days (thanks to our pyramids view room at Le Meridien) admiring them but it really didn&#x2019;t help. Instead of any of our questions answered, our curiosity and astonishment only escalated.Must eat:Pool &amp;amp; the Pyramids- one frame at Le Meridien, Giza :)Picture perfect moment- with all the 3 Great PyramidsZööbaHotelsMap&#x2022;\tZooba, Zamalek: Hands-down our favourite restaurant in Cairo. We went there not once, not twice but thrice and even packed our airport dinner from here. Make sure you try everything on the menu.Koshari Abu Tarek Egyptian Resturant - Dubai - United Arab EmiratesHotelsMap&#x2022;\tAbou Tarek, Downtown: You have to try Koshary when in Cairo and you have to try it at Abou Tarek. Koshary is Egypt&#x2019;s national dish, is surprisingly 100% vegetarian and is a refreshing version of what we know as pasta.Yummiest Koshari ever :pSequoiaHotelsMap&#x2022;\tSequoia, Zamalek: This upscale lounge is simply about the view and the breeze. Situated at the edge of the Zamalek island, Sequoia is where the paparazzi in Cairo head to every evening. The 250 EGP cover charge is a real bargain for being pampered like an Egyptian Pharaoh.Stay:&#x2022;\tHaving spent a week in different locations in Cairo, Giza has won our vote for the top spot for a 2-night stay. Just do yourself a favour and book a Pyramids view room at the Le Meridien in Giza.&#x2022;\tJust in case you still have to stay in the city, avoid Downtown and instead opt for the trendy Zamalek island. The President Hotel is an ideal choice to experience authentic local hospitalityA bulk of the excursions in Aswan and Luxor are part of the overall Nile cruise package. Below are our favourites and certainly ones you cannot miss. For our cruise, we were on Royal Esadora, an excellent value for money for all meals and excursions. (For more details on how to score a cheap Nile cruise, read Things you cannot afford to not know before you go)Aswan (2 Nights- on the cruise)Must see:&#x2022;\tThe Unfinished Obelisk: In the largest red granite quarry in Egypt, lies the obelisk which cracked before it could be separated from its mother rock and hence left unfinished. The place is not really about grandeur but about the innovative building methods used by ancient Egyptian.&#x2022; Nile Felucca Ride: Sail on a Felucca to experience the Nile the most authentic way. A visit to one of the Nubian villages (Nubians are Sudanese people living in southern Egypt) gives you a peek into the traditional way of life.&#x2022;\tVery early morning trip to Abu Simbel: This trip is not for the faint-hearted. It involves a 3am wake-up and 6 hours drive for a 1 hour visit to the Abu Simbel temple. The result though is breathtaking. Standing at 21m, the four statues of Ramses II, one of the longest serving Egyptian pharoahs is a sight to behold.Some facts: Rames II rules Egypt for more than 60 years, fathered more than 200 children, died at the age of 90 (a rarity during those times) and his mummy rests peacefully at the Egyptian museum (one of the must see mummies when you are there).Luxor (1 Night- on the cruise)Must see:&#x2022;\tThe Valley of the Kings: Here lies the boy king, Tutankhamun. Nothing can describe how we felt when we entered the tomb KV62, his final resting place. The tombs of the pharaohs in this valley, the paintings and the elaborate heliographic inside stands testament to the unshakeable belief the Egyptians had in the afterlife. So tuck away your phones and listen to your guide. He will have some of the most interesting stories to tell!Hurghada (2 Nights)Must see/do:&#x2022;\tDiving / Snorkeling Trip: I dived, I dived, I dived and I still cannot believe it! I cannot swim and I dived!. One of the most exhilarating experiences of my life.&#xA0;Here are the feelings I went through:&#x2663;\tAnxiety: waiting for my turn and seeing others &#x2018;drown&#x2019;&#x2663;\tFear: inside the water, with my guide slowing lowering the pressure taking me down&#x2663;\tAwestruck: gazing at my mask-magnified colourful corals and marine life&#x2663;\tVictorious: climbing back to our yatch after a successful dive&#x2022;\tLazing around on the beach: For the rest of the days, we adhered to the holy trinity of a beach holiday: Eat,Laze and SwimStay:The evening Nile View and the awesome food at Sequoia:)Sheraton Soma Bay ResortHotelsMapThere is no dearth of luxury in this small red sea resort town. We chose Sheraton Soma Bay, it offered a complete package in terms of price, facilities, and location.They say, Soma Bay is one of the most beautiful to swim in and boy! were they right then the said that. The water was blue, clear and saline enough for me to float. No man can ask for more!Planning a trip already?

Perhaps the people nowadays get too busy to seek redemption after their death and simply not during the time they have to spend in this world of ours . Day 7 : After a wonderful time spent in Malana we headed back to our base in Kasol , took rest for a day and then headed to Barshani. Barshani is around 24 km from Kasol and one can either go viva local bus or take a cab as per their convince . One can either go towards Tosh which is kinda commercialised by enormous number of tourist&apos;s , so we decided to move towards the 3 villages Pulga , Kulga and Katagla . These are small villages situated in the mountain just across the river from barshani . A not so long trek of around 25 min - 45 min will lead you to a small village of Pulga . This village is isolated and according to me it is a blessing that it is yet to be discovered by our Indian tourists. You&apos;ll mostly find foreign tourists and it is really not commercialised as other places.&#xA0; The village seems to be a really peaceful place with good local people who majorly are farmers. The place also has probably the cheapest accommodations and nominal rates for food . You will find a few caf&#xE9; in the village and you can fetch a room for as low as Rs200/- per day .The major attractions lies in the Fairy Forest. The coniferous forest is spreaded over the whole mountain and is majorly infamous for the secret rave parties held in the region. Once you start from the starting of the forest you&apos;ll have to trek for just 15 min to reach the first flatten land (also know as cricket ground by the locals). This is usually the first base for ravers and is a pretty amazing spot to chill around with your friend . But perhaps if you are not satisfied with it you always have an option to burn some more fat and trek to the 2nd base which is around 3-4km above thee been made aware of a place&#xA0; first level . This level is perhaps nothing less than a paradise for someone visiting for the first time green lands in between the slope of the mountain is a magical view one can lit a camp fire and set up a camp for a overnight stay .

		"Text": "Day 1It was 23 June, I remember from last few days there was a heavy rainfall in many parts of City, but we were planning to escape for a while, Another reason was Kalsubai was on my mind since many days..so it was a golden opportunity to take this chance...So Finally on saturday we left from Pune. The total group was of 30 people.It was raining heavily since last 2 days but it had stopped for sometime. I was accompanied with my 2 best friends, Rutuja &amp; Ashish...and the other guy Akash whom we all had met during one of pur treks to Vasota.The journey begin at Night..around 10.30 and soon we were all asleep. The only thing which we could feel were the up &amp;&#xA0; down roads. It was impossible to get a view out of window..as nothing was visible. After few hours and few stops in between soon we reached the village..After sitting for so much time in bus..legs very already paining..We took our bags &amp; started walking one after another. We reached a place which was similar to a small construction site. Even though there was no enough space for everyone..we tried to accomodate ourselves wherever possible.We slept fpr almost 2 hours. It was only around 6.30 that we wake up and had breakfast &amp; tea. The place were we had tea was a small place..which was already full of people from other trekking groups. This time we had went with &quot;Beyond Mountains&quot;.There was a introduction round and soon we started walking away from place were we had stayed. After few minutes of walking we were able to see a board pointing to Kalsubai peak &amp; a small temple near by...First the road was nice..with no big climb. After few short climbs there was were some stalls on the ways..we just stopped to take the view of Green Nature around us..it was tiring for all of us..as we were doing the trek after many days..After few initial climbings and stopping in between whenver necessary we came to the first ladder..The part where climbing is difficult is supported by ladders for convinence.. when we crossed the first ladder it was magical..we were in clouds and the wind started getting harsh..i was shivering. There was also rains in between to increase the difficulty..visiblity kept on going low..The view was not visible as everything was covered in clouds but yes it was beautiful at that moment i thought can heaven be different than this....Afterwards it seemed that the peak was getting far &amp; far away...There was a considerable distance between first ladder &amp; second ladder.Monkeys were creating another trouble..snatching the bags &amp; food material of all the fellow trekkers. As the raining was there continously..the roads started getting slippery &amp; was even more difficult with the monkeys troubling people. There was a huge queue of people on ladders.. I felt as if this space is not enough.The real challenge was the third ladder it was getting difficult for us to stand as we had exhausted most of our energy and also third ladder was full of people. People travelling downwards &amp; upwards at same time. There were some people who were trying to co ordinate..but with some many trekking groups&#xA0; and sunday rush..we had no option but waiting ....&#x1F60F;AFTER the long wait of almost half..we were more than eager to see what was there on the top...there was a person who had a dog accompanied him..on the top &amp;&#xA0; while coming down the ladder the dog was already frightened by the huge number of people. When the dog came down with his owmer there was a huge round of plaws..( for the paws..&#x1F436;).We climbed the third ladder and reached the top. The wind had crossed all the limits of worseness...All&#xA0; were lined up one after another for getting down.. There was a long queue of people trying to come up..and at the same time there was a long queue of people trying to go down..the place on the top was very little..there was a small temple of Kalsubai devi..With so many people and jolly enviornment...it was not less that &quot; JATRA&quot;..For the moment I named it as &quot;KALSUBAI CHI JATRA&quot; and smiled at my own silly idea...We got very less time to be on the top &amp; barely any photos...as the cold wind was forcing us to go in one direction...the atomosphere over top was clumsy...we were shivering....but the feeling of being on the&#xA0; &quot;Kalsubai : Everest of Maharashtra &quot; was not less than climbing the real&#xA0; everest....We came down just in few minutes..the situation on 3rd ladder was worse. I feared there could have been a stampede...After coming down..near a small well..there were stalls were we had tea &amp; Maggi and the feeling was awesome...Getting downwards was more difficult then we had imagined because the roads were muddy..small streams of water were started...Everyone was getting slipped because of the roads..Finally we came down..around 4pm..we started around 7 in morning...reached by 10.30 and came down by 4pm.. but what i felt was the kalsubai would have been more nice..If ir would had been less people...But overall experience was nice...about the trekking group &quot; Beyond Mountains &quot;&#xA0; i would never recommend it to anybody..as my experience was not good....I had some of the best memories....making new friends..travelling..all the moments...Other than this I would like people to visit this &quot; Everest of MAHARASHTRA &quot; atleast once in a lifetime.....&#x1F493;TREK BEGINS..GroupIn mountains..far behindGirl GangStill far..Solo..????Trek mates",

		"Text": "Europe stays one of my all-time favourite backpacking destination. From cheap accommodations to reasonably priced flights, the entire vacation if planned well can easily be done under a lakh for 1-2 weeks of stay. If you want to however experience luxury, or travel to some of the more premium cities across the continent, then one of the best ways to do so is through a luxury cruise.Contrary to the belief that has come across over decades, cruising is one of the cheapest ways to experience luxury in Europe. After having planned a cruise across some exotic parts of Europe last year, here are my pointers on planning a cruise vacation.Best time to visit:While there will be options available throughout the year, most Europe cruises operate between April-September with maximum cruises available between June-September.Popular routes: Depending on the time of your visit, there are popular operators such as MSC &amp; Royal Caribbean amongst others with cruises broadly covering routes around these cities:&#x2022;\tEastern Mediterranean Cruises-Greece, Turkey, Venice, Italy, Croatia&#x2022;Western Mediterranean Cruises- Rome, Florence, Spain, French Riviera&#x2022;\tScandinavia &amp; the Baltics &#x2013; Russia, Copenhagen etc.&#x2022;\tEuropean River Cruises- Popular river routes right from Amsterdam to Berlin &amp; Prague\nEuropeHotelsMapThere are also other known routes in the British Isles, Norway and the Black Sea.Route for the cruise i booked on MSC MeravigiliaRoute for the cruise i booked on MSC MeravigiliaCosts:&#x2022;\tCruise fares are normally all inclusive and cover accommodation, meals, activities, entertainment and transportation between 2 ports. This itself covers most of your trip expenses, however like most luxury or package tours, this one comes with its own baggage of hidden costs such as costs for special entertainment acts, daily gratuity, alcohol exclusions as per your packages etc., hence it&#x2019;s very important to read the fine print carefully before booking.&#x2022;\tWhile choosing a tour package, 2 things are to be considered mainly, the type of room that you are selecting and the beverage package that you want.  Room Type: Rooms are normally classified into Interior rooms, Balcony and Ocean view. While the interior rooms are the cheapest, they can seem a little claustrophobic particularly if it&#x2019;s a long duration cruise, however if you are on a budget and plan to spend most of the time outside then they are extremely value for money(Do consider the fact that decks can get crowded in the evening and you might want some fresh air after a particularly long day out on excursions while relaxing in your room). The balcony rooms offer a very small window looking out of the room and hence are not worth paying that extra money for. Ocean view rooms are what I would normally suggest, even if they do cost a bit extra than most. Take this for an example, on the cruise that I booked for, the cost was as follows: inside view-$600pp, balcony-$800pp and ocean view-$1000 pp. Beverage package: This normally consists of alcoholic and nonalcoholic packages. While an all-inclusive alcoholic package may seem exciting, consider the fact that not only do they have daily upper limits to the maximum alcohol or type of alcohol you can consume in this package; you will also be out for most of the day for excursions and even if you do think of getting all your money&#x2019;s worth while on deck at night , binge drinking on a ship everyday when you have an excursion in the morning might not seem like a great idea the next day.Approx. Costing pp: Flights (45000) + Cruise (65000) + Excursions (25000) = 1,45,000 approx. pp.Excursions:&#x2022;\tThere are many ways to explore the city, you can opt for a free walking tour (which is my favourite way to explore Europe!) or take a package for the cruise excursions. Cruise excursions are not that heavily priced and can be customised for individual tours.(Approx. 40-50$ pp for a city tour) Also they come with an added advantage wherein there is a Worry Free Back to Ship guarantee , wherein in the rare event that you miss reaching the ship back on time , they take up the responsibility of dropping you to the next destination at no extra cost.&#x2022;\tOffshore cruise excursions are particularly a great idea if you want to look at exotic unknown locations which may not be that accessible otherwise on your own.Before/After the cruise&#x2022;\tA great option to get the maximum out of your cruise package, is to also look at exploring cities apart from the ones covered in the cruise before or after your cruise. So, if you are flying down to let&#x2019;s say Barcelona for the start of your cruise, then doing day trips or visiting nearby places like Montserrat by flying in a day to two before is a great option!&#x2022;\tLet go of your Travellers&#x2019; guilt. While you may want to explore Europe at leisure, remember that Europe is huge and one of the cons of going on a cruise is that the amount of time you get to explore in each city will be very limited. Most ships will give you a day or so to explore that city before moving onto the next destination. It is thus best described as most to be a sampler effect. Remember that the main reason you are on a cruise, is to get that experience and can always come back someday for exploring a city that you loved.Things to Remember&#x2022;\tArrive 1 day before your cruise boarding starts in the departure city, you don&#x2019;t want to miss your entire cruise because of flight delays!&#x2022;\tRemember to choose a cruise which offers you enough days at sea as well to explore the ship thoroughly. A good cruise ship will have multiple levels of options offering entertainment and other activities. If you are paying that extra cost for a cruise, keep some time to enjoy it too.&#x2022;\tBeware of any additional charges that they might charge you, inflated charges such as Souvenir photos, Tips/Gratuity etc. are just some of the costs that might be added to your room charge. &#x2022;\tIf you are worried about being sea sick, then unless it&#x2019;s particularly stormy, cruise ships are big in tonnage and come well equipped with stabilizers which help in avoiding you to experience it.Unlike other continents, Europe is relatively compact and blessed with most cities being connected to a port or just a short bus ride away. So, whether it&#x2019;s your first trip to Europe or you are planning a repeat trip, I urge you to try this experience for your next trip!",

		"Text": "A realm of its own, this Indian Union Territory is a group of islands approx. 400 kms away from the Indian offshore. Archipelago of twelve coral atolls, three reefs, ten uninhabited islands and five submerged ocean banks along with beautiful crystal clear beaches, white sand, abundance of various species of Flora and Fauna with 36 islands of its own and a sprawling lush green landscape. CONNECTIVITY &amp; SPECIAL PERMITSAir India has 1 flight from Kochi to Agatti Island, only one of the islands. You can also find occasional cruises from Mumbai, Cochin etc. I would recommend to take a flight to enjoy the aerial view of the islands covered with forest and the fabulous Agatti airstrip. Ferry, speed boats are available to visit other islands and maybe opt for a helicopter during monsoon seasons. Everybody, Indian or otherwise require special government permit to visit as it is strictly restricted to enter the islands. Obtain permits prior to your vacation for any last minute hassles and carry your approved paperwork along with you. It is highly recommended that you obtain permits to enter and exit and visit the islands and book your package only through government&#x2019;s tour operator SPORTS. Short for Society for promotion of Nature tourism and Sports. They promote eco-friendly tourism and recreational activities in the islands. Book stays and tours through SPORTS as they have beautiful resorts and guest houses to stay overlooking the ocean and scrumptious delicacies served morning and noon. Tables are laid on the white sands in the evening to enjoy sunset with snacks along with bonfire and dinner is served with fresh catch of the day (crabs, octopus, fishes, prawns and more) which you can relish with the ocean breeze and listening to the sounds of the waves.\nKadmat IslandHotelsMapOnly BSNL and Airtel provides telecommunication services to Lakshadweep Islands.Lakshadweep is not a budget destination but all prices are inclusive when booked through SPORTS.MUST VISIT ISLANDS &amp; DIVING SITESAgatti IslandHotelsMapThe gateway for Lakshadweep, you can visit Agatti once you land. It has one of the most beautiful lagoons. The airport is built only on this island.Agatti AerodromeHotelsMapKadmat IslandHotelsMapI would recommend staying at this island as this island in houses beautiful resort amidst palm grooves and is ideal for watersports as PADI (The Professional Association of Diving Instructors) functions from here itself. You will be trained before going for the dive.It has long sandy beaches and a bountiful nature to embrace in. Variety of fishes like shark, stingrays and beautiful corals can be found and the ocean gives you a clear visibility of 20 &#x2013; 50 m underwater. You can tour the Coconut powder and jute factory and purchase pure coconut oil, powder from these factories.Minicoy IslandHotelsMapThis is isolated from all the islands in Lakshadweep. It has the largest lagoon and one uninhabited islet. You can wonder at the colourful race boats found in this island. Main tourist attraction is the 300 foot tall lighthouse built in 1885 by the Britishers.KavarattiHotelsMapCalmest lagoons can be found in this island. It in houses a mosque, marine aquarium and is the home for Dolphin dive site. Due to silent and calm ocean nature, this is an ideal place for swimming and snorkeling or just laze around in the sun. Fish pickles and small souvenirs can be collected from this island.BangaramHotelsMapBANGARAM &amp; THINNAKARANSpecial mention needs to be given to these two islands. Situated overlooking each other with beautiful camps set up on the sandy beaches with phosphorescent plankton washed ashore gives a bluish glow to the oceans at night, and a shipwreck underwater, this is an island not to miss at all.SCUBA DIVING SITE &amp; VISIBILITY UNDERWATERBest islands for dive: Kadmat and Bangaram.Scuba dive prices : &#x20B9; 3000-6000Currents : Calm waters to strong, depending upon the tides and the dive siteDepth of Dive : 15 m to 40 mDifficulty Level : Easy-ChallengingVisibility in the waters : More than 35 mYou need to be medically fit to dive and a consent and medical forms need to be filled out. Only worry remains is to adjusting yourself and your breathing techniques deep underwater. Any kind of uneasiness or pain felt during your dive, its better to reach out to your instructor with the hand signals that will be taught prior to your dive at the PADI institute. Oxygen tanks will be provided with life jackets when you reach the diving spot in a ferry. You need to leave your feet from the ferry ladder and then you can dive and go down with the help of your instructor to another universe.You can always opt for a lagoon dive with shallow waters or deep sea dive. You also have the option of diving at night or morning.PADI certification courses can be taken from Kadmat island, where you stay at the resort along with other tourists and also go for dives morning and at night.SEASONBest time to visit Lakshadweep is from October to mid-May. From mid-May to September it is rainy. Though all the resorts in Lakshadweep are open throughout the year, reaching there by ship is difficult during monsoon. Reaching resorts like Kadmat, Minicoy and Kavaratti is difficult as they are not connected by flight or helicopter during monsoon time.WATERSPORTSIf you are into watersports you have Dolphin dive centre in Kavaratti Islands, Kadmat Scuba diving centre and minicoy dive centre.DON&#x2019;T&#x2019;sSpecial Attention to be paid that you donot pick any corals as souvenirs, as it is a punishable offence. Drinking is prohibited on all islands except Bangaram.This place is a must go once in a lifetime. The feeling of letting go once you are deep underwater, the floating away with the sea, the calmness, walking on the sea bed while the school of magnificent fishes greet you with a hi ! , the lightness of your body as if you are in an unknown universe is definitely an altered experience.",

But was it a bachelor&apos;s? It surely qualifies for that if there is no other such happening trip before my marriage.\nDay 1Terminal 3HotelsMapI have covered other interesting places as well which you can check on my blog here.So it all started on a fine Friday night when I and one of my office friend Abhishek took our first international flight to Bangkok from IGI Airport.So we went with the cheapest direct flight which was available i.e., spice jet. But I&apos;d highly recommend that you choose some other global carrier as it was really uncomfortable. Moreover, it was packed with Indian families and was worse than any AC 3-tier typical Indian rail with kids roaming and crying during the entire journey. It took us almost 4 hrs before we could see the clear Bangkok skyline and landed on Suvarnabhumi Airport around 4:30 AM.I&apos;ll try to give all the required information and a perfect day wise itinerary so that you can cover everything without spending much.Bangkok NoiHotelsMapVisa on Arrival signboard is everywhere on the Suvarnabhumi airport and Indian passport holders can apply for 15 days tourist Visa on arrival which costs 2000B. Some of the necessary documents to be shown are:4. Sufficient Funds- 10,000B/ person or 20,000B/ familyBut I&apos;d say it&apos;s better to take visa beforehand as it is cheaper (around Rs 2700) as well as would save you from long queues especially when you have arrived in a full packed Indian flight. One thing I noticed as well was that government officials are slow whether its India or Thailand (no offense).Lot of us while going abroad for the first time have a question regarding phone connectivity to stay in touch with our bosses. There are three options to choose from: one you take your boss with you (highly not recommended), two- go with international roaming which I think is not a good Idea too as network sucks in India and I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be able to provide services abroad, third is to buy a local pre-paid sim card. The third option is much more reliable in Thailand as it provides high-speed internet as well as international calling. I went for AIS sim and, it was really good.Going from Bangkok to PattayaThere are various options available such as bus, taxi, self-rental car, limo, train. One can pick and choose depending upon their pockets. I&apos;d suggest taking Roong Reuang bus service (available at level-1 near gate no. 8) which costs 120B/ person as you&apos;ll be requiring a lot of funds in Pattaya. So try saving wherever possible.Pattaya CityHotelsMapYou can de-board the bus at North, central or south Pattaya stops depending upon the location of your hotel.Believe me, the food is not good and vegetarians will have a hard time finding a good restaurant. I was surviving on veggie delight Subway (ate 4 times out of 10 meals), Margherita pizza (ate twice), Bread butter, fruits, chips (rest of the time). You&apos;ll find Indian restaurants here and there but the food really sucks. I ordered aloo parantha and Lassi to be on the safe side but they made it clear that better stay hungry than going to an Indian restaurant.The water there is not served free as in case of most Indian restaurants so you&apos;ll need to buy everytime from a nearby Seven-Eleven or family mart store which is located at every 100m.For non-vegetarians options are little wider if you like seafood. Otherwise, KFC, burger king, subway and dominos are the only options as they don&apos;t know how to make that desi butter chicken as well.We stayed at IBIS which is situated in North Pattaya. It&apos;s a decent hotel but room sizes are like Mumbai PG&apos;s. The breakfast was good with a lot of non-vegetarian options. They tried making Indians happy by cooking Rajma, Poha, and Upma but failed with shining colors in their unsuccessful attempt.Hotel check-in: 2PM (They don&apos;t give room before that, even if you have traveled all the way and struggled to reach there safely, so plan accordingly)Hotel Check-out: 2PM (They will come 15mins before to remind you that your time is over :P)Don&apos;t take the taxi. They will charge you a lot of money and will try to fool you about the exact distance. In Pattaya, the tuk-tuk service is available everywhere, which is much cheaper. But the trick is that don&apos;t ask about them the destination. Just hop-in, open Google maps and hop-out giving 10B to the driver as soon as your destination arrives.Pattaya BeachHotelsMapAgain expectations? Sorry, you need to click the red cross button in the top right corner once again for more details. After checking in to the hotel it was time to hit the beach Pattaya beach which was almost at a 2 min walk. Pattaya beach is not that clean as one would expect as it is situated at the heart of the city however itis a popular place for various water sports. The overall view is surely mesmerizing with tall buildings on one end hiding the sun and beautiful Thai ladies on the other.There are various sightseeing places which we tried covering:Its a highly recommended must watch ladyboy cabaret show which is famous all across the globe. There are other similar shows as well such as Alcazar, but I bought tickets for Tiffany as it is considered the best.One recommendation here would be that don&apos;t buy tickets from the venue, instead get it online from Klook or explore travel agents on the beach road which will give you VIP seats in 900B.The incredible talents of the transvestite and transgender community, drawn from all corners of the Thai kingdom, are showcased in a display of spectacular exotic scenes, enhanced by the latest lighting and sound technology. Extravagant costumes, toe-tapping choreography, and beautiful &apos;showgirls&apos; will ensure your night at Tiffany&apos;s is one to remember.This is the place in Pattaya for which most of the people are crazy about. The street is located in the south Pattaya region and houses a number of famous clubs such as Insomania, Nasha (an Indian club which plays desi and Punjabi songs), massage centers, local food joints etc. The street is colorful and lively with beautiful girls pulling and begging you to enter their bars.But beware most often they are ladyboys. It&apos;s actually really hard to differentiate between and a girl and a ladyboy in Pattaya.At the walking street, it gets clear that why it is considered as the paradise on earth as girls and alcohol both are in plenty.Since we were short of cash on the first day itself, we decided to head straight to the beach with a can of beer and call it a day.Tinder Ok as most of you would know that it is a dating app, but it totally has a different meaning in Pattaya. So while sitting at the beach and after having a couple of sips, we thought of trying tinder in Pattaya. You never know you might find someone good as people have found their life partners on such trips. But unlike India, here it&apos;s totally opposite which means you&apos;ll get match 90% of the time. We both were in seventh heaven after getting so many matches in a fraction of few minutes. But as I started the conversation with one of the pretty girls and behaved like a complete gentleman by asking how she was doing? She replied she was good and if I want her or not?So obviously I couldn&apos;t say no! but how could have said yes either? Anyway, I wrote yes and instantly she replied 2000 full night.Yeah, so you got that right. The girl&apos;s there are using tinder to get business and if you are trying to show your charm and want to date someone genuinely, I&apos;d rather recommend hitting the bar and offering someone a drink.Football matchJust like India, Pattaya has a lot of football fan following too. And on that day, it was the champions trophy final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. I never really followed football but that day was fun, we went to an open bar, watched the match, played snooker and had a couple of more beers. Ladies, there were crazy about Real Madrid and mocked Abhishek every time we passed that bar as Liverpool lost that match.Day 2Koh Larn IslandHotelsMapDay-2 (Time to get adventurous)So on the day-2, we had planned some water sports and coral Island tour. You can book this tour online as it is comparatively cheaper than what you&apos;ll get there.The tour is properly planned and is inclusive of a shared cab which will pick you up from the hotel on time. So after the breakfast, we headed towards the beach where our guide gave us certain instructions which were really funny as he tried to speak English but was suffering like anything.The activities were safe and were accompanied by instructors. The tour is systematic as I mentioned earlier with defined timelines. But there is a con too that I felt a little restrictive as we hardly got time for other relaxation and exploring the island on our own. So if you are a sports enthusiast you may take this tour otherwise its better to go on your own.All in all the tour was fun and it&apos;s better to do in the group as you meet a lot of new people. So we met Chee hon from Korea who was a firefighter, Jackson who was a chef and couple of Chinese and Russian guys as well.Lunch I don&apos;t know what I ate that day. It was vegetarian for sure, some curry with rice along with a soup. Over the lunch, I met a couple of Indians who were from Mumbai and had come straight to Pattaya. So as an Indian, how can I not advise and miss the opportunities of giving them the tips to survive and live in Pattaya. Afterall, I had spent a full day there and was fully aware of the cabs, girls, walking street and food. I don&apos;t know whether I was missing someone to speak with in Hindi or had so much to share.P.S: Abhishek didn&apos;t speak muchWe spent the rest of the day at leisure scouting for food, some shopping as we realized its just a day which was left in Pattaya.Day 3Art In ParadiseHotelsMapDay-3 (covering the rest)We started our day with a visit to art in paradise which is 3D museum. Below are some of the photos which we clicked while we were there. Some of them are really crazy.Sanctuary of TruthHotelsMapIt&apos;s a beautiful Buddha temple situated on the seashore. Most of the people don&apos;t visit the temples while in Pattaya but we being firm believers of God couldn&apos;t miss the true Nirvana (Sarcasm).We couldn&apos;t go inside, not because the temple was closed but because we were literally out of money and 500 Baht at that time seemed too much for an entry to a temple.Jom Tien BeachHotelsMapIn the evening we went to one of the less explored and cleaner Jomtien beach. The beach is a little far from main Pattaya street and is mostly surrounded by the residential complexes. But its comparatively lot cleaner and peaceful. So if someone is looking for good beaches, Jomtien is a must.Day-4 (Time to leave Pattaya)After checking out from the hotel we headed straight to Pattaya bus stand and boarded on the bus to Bangkok.I&apos;ll cover Bangkok in a separate chapter as it is totally different from what we experienced in Pattaya.",

It gets quite costly, can be more than&#xA0;INR 10,000&#xA0;from Leh to Delhi 2.&#xA0;Take your raincoats with you, weather can be very harsh. 3.&#xA0;Keep warmers; both upper and lower. Carry gloves that can protect you from cold as well as rain (we didn&#x2019;t have&#xA0;&#x1F61E;) 4.&#xA0;Ask for bikes with carriage, petrol pumps are quite far away, carry extra petrol. 5. Do check weather before embarking on to Nubra valley and/ or Pangong 6. Keep yourself hydrated throughout the trip. Oxygen levels keep changing and you will realize only when you get totally exhausted. So keep drinking water. 7. Don&apos;t sleep, whether on bike or in car, you might miss some beautiful shaded mountains or your childhood scenery. &#x1F604; Day 1:&#xA0;23rd&#xA0;June, 2018, Landed in Srinagar @ 2:30 PM Weather: Clear Sunny Mode of Transport: - Flight, Taxi I came from Bangalore, had the flight with a stopover at Amritsar. Other 3 joined me on the same flight and we all landed together in Srinagar at 14:30 hours We had no clue what next 8 days were going to be for us. The weather was unpredictable; we tried pre-booking bikes so that we can go from Srinagar to leh on bikes, but in vain. Bikes with other numbers rented from Srinagar are not allowed into Leh and vice-versa, this is what we were told. However there is a way out of this:-&#xA0;If you have rented bikes from Srinagar or any other place, you have to bypass the check posts before 6 AM in Leh, otherwise you will have to pay little money to the agents standing there. We decided to go by taxi from Srinagar to Leh and rent out bikes from Leh itself. We didn&apos;t want our trip to get spoiled for any reason. Coming back to Srinagar airport @ 14:30 hours. There is a kiosk for hotel and taxi booking at the airport. We negotiated with him for hotel stay in Srinagar and for taxi fare (INR 14,500) from Srinagar to Leh with 1 day stay @ Kargil.(will elaborate about this trip later) From airport then we went to Dal lake area. You can either get a&#xA0;personal taxi for INR 730&#xA0;or&#xA0;shared taxi with INR 150 per head. We bargained here and paid&#xA0;INR 450 for 4 people.&#xA0;We reached Dal lake. There are hotels on one side and house boats on the other. Many options available.&#xA0;Do Bargain!! You can get rooms at reasonable prices One of the shikara owner came to us and offered to show us houseboats for stay. After negotiating at 2-3 houseboats, we finalized a 2 bedroom with attached washroom house boat for&#xA0;INR 1600 per day.&#xA0;House Boat Meeraj (It was not market facing).&#xA0;The ones facing market might charge you more. After freshening up, we then went out to eat something. We had heard a lot about&#xA0;Mughal Darbar,&#xA0;so we went there.&#xA0;We ordered&#xA0;Kashmiri Waz-Wan (traditional Kashmiri dish; not everyone will like the taste, so order one portion first) and Kawa chai (without milk). We also tried Kashmiri veg pulao. We liked it much more than anything else we ordered. &#x1F606; After having food, later that evening we went out to search for rental bikes. We were planning to go to Pahalgam the next day. Here you have three options now to visit Pahalgam:- 1.&#xA0;Rent a bike (which we did) @&#xA0;INR 1200-1500&#xA0;depending on the season and availability of bikes. We rented royal enfield classic 350 from KashmirMOJO, Opp. DIG Office, Govt. Building Municipality Road, Srinagar- 190010 (Kashmir)- The owner is Imran Wali. Very friendly person and he himself is a biker, he has travelled to Leh Ladakh several times. And if you want to add or delete anything from your itinerary, he is the right man.&#xA0;Contact no. 9070200200,&#xA0; Email:&#xA0;kashmirmojo@gmail.com&#xA0; 2.&#xA0;Hire a taxi: Approximately&#xA0;INR 5000 for up down 3.&#xA0;You can go by bus, the prices of which are very low. But how much will this be convenient and time saving is left to you to decide. So we had bikes with us and next morning we would head out to Pahalgam. Now, since we were staying in houseboat, where should we park the bikes? &#x1F625; There are many parking places opposite the ghaats (lake side). There is one parking opposite Ghaat no. 3. They will charge&#xA0;INR 100 per bike per day.&#x1F60A; The day ended with some roadside food on Dal Lake Street, lots of talks, and plans for coming days. Day 2PahalgamHotelsMapWeather: Clear SunnyMode of Transport: - Royal Enfield Classic 350We got ready and had a breakfast from the roadside dhaba. Distance to&#xA0;Pahalgam&#xA0;from Srinagar is around-&#xA0;95 Km. It will take around 2.5-3 hours to reach Pahalgam. From Pahalgam the distance to&#xA0;Aru Valley&#xA0;is about&#xA0;13 Km&#xA0;while distance to Betaab Valley is 7 Km. We reached Pahalgam by 2 PM. We went towards&#xA0;Aru Valley. Great ride along with the Lidder river flow and excellent scenery !! &#x1F60D; Later, we went towards Betaab valley, but the roads were jammed and we decided to head back to Srinagar. We reached Srinagar by 7 PM, and headed to&#xA0;Lal chowk. The market is quite big with many eateries and shopping points. It is safe to go to the area. We had our dinner at&#xA0;Ahdoos restaurant; another famous place with good ambiance. It is not very far from Lal chowk. Quality of food was great. Must try.&#xA0; We then went to our house boat. And we packed our bags for next day. Day 3KargilHotelsMapSrinagar to kargil, distance: 200 kmWeather: Clear Sunny, Cold winds in DrasMode of Transport: - Mahindra Xylo (Taxi)We started at 10:30 AM from Srinagar in a hired taxi- Xylo (great condition and driver was very friendly). We booked this taxi for&#xA0;INR 14,500Driver&#x2019;s name was Sharif (Contact: +917051641413) and he belonged to Kargil.Through our journey, main spots where we stopped:-1.&#xA0;Sonamarg: - Snow covered hills, pristine beauty (We were totally into the beauty that we forgot to click here&#x1F611;)2.&#xA0;Baltal: Amarnath Yatra base camp: - You can see the camp from above3. Zojila Pass: - Height 11,575 ft. or 3,528m. One of the high mountain pass on Srinagar-Leh highway. This is the same place where tunnel project was recently inaugurated by PM of India; Narendra Modi. This will reduce time to cross Zojila from more than 3 hours to only 15 minutes &#x1F632;&#xA0; 4.&#xA0;Dras:- Kargil War Memorial&#xA0;&#x2013; We reached Dras valley, this happens to be second coldest place on earth after Siberia, Russia. Free entry, You will be given briefing by Army man about the Kargil war (Between India &amp; Pakistan in 1999). Visit the Manoj Pandey Gallery within the memorial. All details about the war and the soldiers who lost lives defending their Nation&#xA0;are displayed here. Tiger Hill can be seen from this place. Must visit5.&#xA0;Kargil- Very peaceful area. Suru River runs through it. Overnight stay. Got a decent room with attached washroom for&#xA0;INR 900&#xA0;(If you happen to take same taxi, ask Sharif, he will take you to this home stay; stay here only if you want to just sleep, your shouting, laughing loudly can disturb your neighbors)&#x1F604;. It&apos;s a small town, you will not find many options for eating here. We had simple dinner and slept off.Day 4LehHotelsMapKargil to Leh, distance: 220 kmWeather: Clear Sunny, Cold in eveningMode of Transport: - Mahindra Xylo (Taxi)We started at 10 AM. Had quick breakfast. (Pranthe and omelette)&#xA0;Places on the way:-1.&#xA0;Namik La:-&#xA0;12,139 ft. or 3700 m. We experienced high speed winds here. Stop and take photos.

Again high speed winds. Stop and take a photo Next&#xA0;we reached moonland topography of Lamayuru !! Look at the beauty here3. Zanskar-Indus river Sangam:-&#xA0;We reached sangam point. Very beautiful and clear distinction of two rivers coming from different directions and forming single river. The greenish colored is Indus while the silted colored is Zanskar river.4. Hall of Fame:-&#xA0;This is memorial constructed in memory of our soldiers who laid their lives in various wars. You will be charged fees of&#xA0;INR 100&#xA0;for adults and additional for using your DSLR and even clicking photos with your mobile camera. It&#x2019;s&#xA0;4 km&#xA0;before Leh city A pic that is one of our best en route&#xA0;&#x1F60D;We reached Leh by 7 PM and we took a place to stay.&#xA0;Max Alexandra guest house. About 500 meters from Leh main market, Fort Road and Changspa road. We took 2 rooms for&#xA0;INR 700&#xA0;each We asked the care takers at the guest house to arrange bikes for us. We bargained in that too. And finally we got 3 Enfield 350 latest models for&#xA0;INR 1100 each. He only kept an id proof.&#xA0;(Driving licence is must) Also you need permits to go to Nubra and Pangong. Only aadhar card photocopy is required for same.

Karu- Shakti- Chang La- Durbuk- Tangste- Lukung- Spangmik- Man- Merak) If you want to get it done yourself, you will have to stand in line and it might take time. Better ask some agent or staff in your hotel to get it done for you, you can save time to visit other places in meantime. After getting all things sorted for next 3 days and resting for some time, we went to Leh market and had dinner in Dream Land restaurant (there are lot of cafes and good eating spots in markets) Day 5LehHotelsMapLeh: Local sightseeingWeather: Cloudy, Little downpour, high speed winds in Stok village, cold airMode of Transport: - Royal Enfield Classic 350We started our day at 10:30 AM.Breakfast @&#xA0;Gesmo German Caf&#xE9;:&#xA0;Excellent food, great variety, decent cost, Must try: Apple juice is fresh.It was drizzling. We had our raincoats with us just in case!!&#xA0; Places visited:&#xA0; &#xA0; 1.&#xA0;Stakna Gompa:-&#xA0;This was the farthest monastery on our planned route and we decided to visit this first and then come back towards Leh. Although you can also visit Hemis Monastery which we decided to visit on our return from pangong lake (but at that time&#xA0;you will be too tired to stop anywhere but guesthouse&#x1F605;). View from the monastery is awesome. (&#xA0;Note:- all monasteries will be same from inside, but views that you will get from top of these will be different) 2.&#xA0;Thiksey Gompa:-&#xA0;On our way back then was thiksey monastery. Another wonderful view from its top. More famous monastery than Stakna.3.&#xA0;Stok Village:-&#xA0;From Thiksey we got free by 2 PM, we decided to visit Stok village, little out of way, around&#xA0;20 KM&#xA0;from Leh. We skipped Shey Palace, on the way from Thiksey towards Leh. It was all cloudy and drizzling. Lonely roads and no one can be seen till far. What a weather and scenery!! We were living our day. We reached Stok monastery. You can see Lord Budha Statue in golden color. When we reached there, it had started raining heavily and had become quite cold. We sat inside the only shop present there that serves maggie, tea, coffee. Rain subsided and we started back to Leh city by 6 PM4.&#xA0;Shanti Stupa:-&#xA0;We still had time; (days in Leh are usually longer, you can see day light till 8 PM), so we decided to visit Shanti Stupa, which is within Leh city. What we had experienced in Stok, we could not enjoy in Shanti Stupa much then. Clicked few photos, sat in meditation hall and came back to our guest house.We then changed, got fresh and headed to Leh market. We enjoyed our dinner at&#xA0;Lamayuru caf&#xE9;: Ate proper Indian food, quality was good. And we went back to our rooms. It was time to pack our bags to carry to Nubra and Pangong. We 4 had got backpacks each. We decided to carry only 2 backpacks with us as we had to tie these on bikes. (2 backpacks on 2 bikes and 2 people on the 3rd bike, you will be charged extra for bungee ropes, we had bought our own with us). We kept 2 backpacks in the guesthouse itself. The staff was quite cooperative and we also booked room for our return back to Leh after 3 days. Slept off peacefully. Day 6DiskitHotelsMapLeh to Diskit (nubra valley), distance: 117kmWeather: Cloudy, Fog, Rainfall, SnowfallMode of Transport: - Royal Enfield Classic 350We started our day @ 10: AM, had breakfast again at Gesmo German bakery.&#xA0;We left by 11 AM. It was raining. I had put on my raincoat.The first stop was to show&#xA0;yellow slips&#xA0;for bikes you rented. This slip is supposed to be given by the person you rent your bike from. We were not given&#x1F611;. But then the lady herself had these, and made it for us. It&#x2019;s merely&#xA0;INR 20&#xA0;for each bike.&#xA0;We then moved ahead. It was cloudy, rainy and foggy and we could already feel the chills.&#x1F632;The checking of permits will take place at&#xA0;South Pullu We then reached&#xA0;Khardungla Pass: 17,982 ft. or ~5,400 meters From Leh to Khardungla; which is only&#xA0;40 KM, it took us around 4+ hours.&#x1F628; The roads are built well; thanks to BRO (Border Road Organization), but as you go towards Khardungla the roads are quite steep. To add to it, the weather was not at all on our side. We were fully packed, warmers, gloves, but fully drenched. Our hands and feet were numb. At times we could not feel them and had to take breaks after every 30-45 minutes, just to warm them and move them in some way so that blood circulation is continuous. We reached Khardungla and felt relieved. The way next was downwards and the weather would get less cold. But while we were at Khardungla, we realized that one of us had developed signs of Peripheral Cyanosis (blue hands).&#x1F62A;, we knew it was not good and consulted the army immediately. Army people have a caf&#xE9; called&#xA0;wanderers&#xA0;managed and run by them there. Full care was taken and we only moved when we could see his hands back to normal.We left after staying there for an hour. Although at such a height, oxygen levels are low and you are not advised to stay&#xA0;for long. Luckily we four didn&#x2019;t feel that and also our attention was more towards getting rid of bluish color. We then started our journey ahead. We then moved and on the way again had to stop. The rain was continuous and we were all drenched. The cold was not leaving us, we were riding very slow and taking breaks frequently. Also on the way, there were so many landslides. So just heads up for people travelling, it was our lucky day (that we survived&#x1F630;). Kindly check weather and plan accordingly. There is no network on the way. God forbid anything happens, all you have is yourself and your peers. It will take time for help to reach. On the way down then comes&#xA0;North Pullu, you can stop and eat something here.After resting for an hour, we then started again. We reached Diskit&#xA0;(which is capital of Nubra valley, we take left turn near Khalsar and travel around 24 Km to reach)&#xA0;around 8 PM. Took a room in hotel called&#xA0;Sunrise Guest house @ INR 1000&#xA0;(contact not available)Had dinner in the guest house only and slept off early. There is no light in Diskit after 11 PM. Day 7Pangong LakeHotelsMapDiskiy to Pangong Lake(spangmik), distance: 165 kmWeather: Clear SunnyMode of Transport: - Royal Enfield Classic 350Next day we woke up without any hope of seeing a sunny weather again since the weather was too bad the previous day.&#xA0;But to our surprise the weather was totally clear. And we were all smiles&#x1F60A;. We finished our breakfast, got our bike tanks full as Diskit petrol pump is the only petrol pump that you would find for next&#xA0;300 KM (there is no petrol pump from diskit to pangong and then pangong to Karu:- Total distance approximately: 288Km)&#xA0;.&#xA0;The road to Pangong Lake is heaven. You have to cross through river beds, other off roads and beautifully laid roads by BRO. You are going to completely cherish the ride.&#xA0;For few moments you will find yourself alone for long stretch of roads and you will love the isolation.Feel yourself, live the moment. We stopped at&#xA0;Durbuk&#xA0;for lunch. Prefer Maggi over anything else. All other options are just an experiment. Keep yourself hydrated all the time. Oxygen levels are low and you will feel exhausted if you do not drink enough water. You will then stop at&#xA0;Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary&#xA0;for entry permit. We reached Pangong lake around 6 PM and what a view. Truly a heaven. The lake is so beautiful, the sunlight on it adds to its beauty.&#x1F60D; You can see all smiles here. The day before we were struggling to reach alive to our destination. We had faced extreme conditions on one day and today, in this moment we were on the most beautiful lake side. We had seen it all, lived it all. the laughs show it all. &#x1F604;After clicking photos for 2 hours, we then headed to look for a place to stay. We stayed in&#xA0;Spangmik (one of the village in Pangong), there are many other places close by. The lake is spread along a large distance. We bargained and got a place to stay for&#xA0;INR 2000&#xA0;only. It was a room with attached washroom and lake facing.&#xA0;After getting fresh, we got down to the lake again. This time with a JBL speaker&#x1F602;. This was the second last day of our trip and we have had a wonderful one. We had faced all sorts of conditions, heights, views, touched another level of friendship. You had heard about sunrise, but here we witnessed moon rise on the lake. Look at the photo attached. We then went for dinner. Everything closes by 11 PM. There is no light in the area after 10:30 PM. After having dinner, we went to room and crashed off.Day 8LehHotelsMapSpangmik to Leh, distance: 156kmWeather: Clear SunnyMode of Transport: - Royal Enfield Classic 350We started early today. We wanted to enjoy an evening in Leh before we go our ways the next morning.The route is same till Durbak from where then you have to take left.We then reached Changla pass- The height of the pass is almost same as Khardungla. Height: 17,590 ft. or 5360 m. Since the weather was sunny, we did not feel as much cold as we had experienced in Khardungla Changla pass- The height of the pass is almost same as Khardungla. Height: 17,590 ft. or 5360 m. Since the weather was sunny, we did not feel as much cold as we had experienced in KhardunglaThe roads are beautiful, and we reached Leh by 5 PM.&#xA0;Some views belowWe went to the guest house: - Max Alexandra.&#xA0;Freshened up and headed out in an hour. Did some shopping (some souvenir, t-shirts, etc.) Again bargain here. Enjoyed the evening in&#xA0;IL Forno rooftop restaurant&#xA0;and later in&#xA0;Leh Chen restaurant. With mixed emotions of wonderful trip coming to an end, we made a pact to make next trip very soon&#x1F60E;. For next day, the staff at guesthouse arranged taxi for dropping us to the airport. Though the airport is only 15-20 minutes from the guesthouse, they will charge you between INR 400-500 Day 9Off from LehWeather: Clear SunnyMode of Transport: - FlightFlights are during early morning hours only from Leh. Mine was Spicejet while other 3 were on Vistara.Everyone went their way, back to the lives we were living but this time with more memories than ever.

This represents awakening, represents the victory of good over evil, represents the light of divinity.\nDay 2Kinnaur KailashHotelsMapThe most magical sunrise I&#x27;ve ever seenAs per the legend, after a great penance, the deadly demon Bhasmasur received a boon from Lord Shiva that he could turn any person into ashes by touching his head. But Bhasmasur tried to turn Lord Shiva into ashes as he wanted to possess his wife, Godess Parvati. Lord Shiva could have easily killed Bhasmasur immediately by opening his third eye, but that would have also led to mass destruction of the planet, which he did not want.So, to avoid getting killed, Lord Shiva stayed in hiding and kept changing his locations often. He finally came to Kinner (Kinnaur) Kailash where he meditated and found a way to control the destruction that could happen when he opens his third eye. And it is here that he eventually killed Bhasmasur by opening his third eye (with controlled aggression).As per the belief such a sunrise is only witnessed when Lord Shiva opens his third eye, which happens only once in several years.P.S. - There are many folklores and mythological stories about places in the world. And many have different versions. So does this. The popular story about this is that Lord Shiva killed Bhasmasur with the help of lord Vishnu. But this particular story was told to me by a local, after he saw this picture of mine.Follow my journeys or connect with me by dropping me a comment here, or on my social media. I do have many many more unheard stories from the Himalayas.InstagramFacebookTwitter",

Mannnn we dint even know we reached and we sat in the train for 15 minutes before we realised we reached ???????????? media said that Kerala was experiencing high floods so not many were there.. Aluva was so beautiful from the glimpses we saw in the train .. super excited to enjoy .. we directly reached boat house in allepy ... God that boat was breathtaking .. we spent the entire day on boat and it was amazing .. it stopped in the evening at a cute market near the river and v purchased huge lobsters and fish for the night .. the boat then stopped near a village were it was a sight I hv never seen in person .. a narrow road with a beatutiful farm on one side and river on other side .. there were small houses and I envied them for being this lucky .. their staple food was fresh fish and vegetables they cultivate from the farm outside .. no rich guy would be able to buy it ???? we even fished with them and danced in the boat balcony all night .. cherished memory for life aluva station train journey boat house boat house balcony view village walk near the boat house boat house view .. look at the weather and it dint rain a bit our lunch at the boat house the farm field near the river our market fish for boat house dinner huge prawns dinner for night Day 2With an average breakfast we departed from the boat house half heartedly to Kovalam.. the plan was to go to thekady but because of the rains we had to go to Kovalam .. I did not expect much coz I was excited to visit the tiger zoo in thekady but had to take this second option .. it was a longggg drive in the cab .. we dint find it boating coz road trip is definitely fun with music and friends .. the driver was extremely patient and understanding .. there was no rains as stated by the media .. the weather was not too sunny or raining .. it was like as though it was gonna rain but dint .. so u can imagine how fantastic it would be .. we wanted to experience Kerala and it&#x2019;s ethnicity .. that&#x2019;s the plan &#x2764;&#xFE0F;&#x2764;&#xFE0F; we stopped for pazhampoori.. (sweet banana bajji)..after that the took us to a fort which was was closed as someone died (am not sure who)..so we took some pictures on the road and headed off for lunch .. there were many hotels on the way but we picked the one that made authentic Kerala food .. and the food was yum to a different level .. the beef and rice was so good that I still can&#x2019;t forget the taste.. we finally reached kovalam beach resort .. our room faced the beach . And the beach was black . They call it black beach ???????? never seen one before .. it drizzled for 5 minutes every 2 hours which made it all special.. the hotel had a pool .. we had fun in the pool while it was drizzling .. that was a splendid experience .. we even made fun with the native Keralites who were friendly with us .. after swimming we directly went with wet clothes to black beach .. sang so loud and clicked pictures .. no one disturbed us .. Kerala people are friendly n respectful .. we came back to the resort .. the owner asked us to take part in the photo shoot for his resort .. we did and he thanked us by sending Kerala payasam (I forgot it&#x2019;s Kerala name) it was too yum .. v ordered food for the night it was costly and not very tasty .. v dint mind as we were very sleepy after a long day .. v slept with happy memories and that&#x2019;s the end of day 2 the fun car drive pazhampoori ❤️our authentic Kerala meals Syrian beef fry our resort room pics in front of the closed fort ????same place different pose swimming pool view from our room beach view from our room black beach black beach Day 3We got ready by 9 to leave Kovalam to Cochin .. it was a long drive .. we got a little tired coz it was long drive for 9 hours .. we stopped for authentic Kerala food .. I tasted pathiri for the first time .. pathiri with beef combo was out of the world .. we saw an elephant being taken in a lorry and was amused .. only happens in Kerala I guess .. the driver saw us get excited and took us to a place where the let us ride on elephants .. we were thrilled but it was so costly 400 per person for 20 minutes .. we were afraid we will miss the flight so we left without experiencing it .. the driver then stopped near Jew town .. we got to see lot of authentic shops .. we went to this mystic shop where a guy sold rings that are designed specially for a person to give prosperity, positivity and strength .. we loved it so much .. he gave each of us rings for our date of birth and time .. my lucky stone was white agate.. I was excited and curious .. we all got rings .. clicked pictures and headed back to the airport .. I was really tired as we travelled the whole day and did very little sight seeing .. brought some chips near the airport .. my mom loves Chaka (jack fruit chips) so got 1 kg for 450 .. and dates pickle .. there were different variety of pickles but I wanted to try this home .. the Kerala locals are so friendly and helpful .. I loved them .. we got to the airport and that&#x2019;s when I remembered that I did not bring an identity card .. all got tensed because of me and I knew for sure that they wouldn&#x2019;t let me in .. to my surprise they let me in with a small verbal warning .. all were surprised I got the boarding pass .. Guess the ring worked it&#x2019;s magic ????&#x263A;&#xFE0F; we boarded the flight and the flight was on time .. I was expecting it to reach early but because of the weather it was just flying round and round above Chennai airport as the run way was not free .. we reached and that was a wrap .. Kerala memories were fun, emotional , thrilling, breathtaking and what not .. I will never forget the memories .. will cherish it always morning having breakfast in Kovalam and checked out one click before v leave the kovalam resort half boiled Kerala fish curry pathiri and beef ????????????elephant getting ready for us me with a Kerala local ????????the mystic ring .. mine is white agate last pic before v leave Kerala",

		"Text": "Waterfalls are a blissThe so called road trip actually known as Youth Trip was organized by our church and, being one of the coordinators the trip was finally planned after five dry years. One would raise the question, why during the off season? Well my answer would be &apos;We finally went for a trip after all the ruckus.&apos;Cost is always a concern when one travels in big groups as such, hence we cooked our own food for the trip. We rented out a mini bus for our travel as we were a group of twenty.\nNot to forget, there will be a troop of monkeys waiting to pounce on you to steal every morsel of food you own. Also, even if you are going anywhere around them please be gentle too. Apart from which you will get refreshing coconut water here which is way better than the ones which you get in your city at a dirt cheap rate. Do give it a try. We stayed at Gaganachukki for about an hour or two and then headed out to Barachukki Falls.It is almost a half hour drive from Gaganachukki to Barachukki Falls, also the drive is uphill here. We reached Barachukki at around 12 in the afternoon. This is one place we regretted coming as there was absolutely no water here and hence no cool snaps of the place too. We didn&apos;t stick around much, so we left in the next half an hour.We all sat and chit chatted for a while and we also bid adieu to two of our church members as they were moving elsewhere. The environment, scenery, everything was just perfect at Sangama and we loved the sunset. After clicking numerous snaps, we broke for tea at 630 to the nearby restaurant at Sangama itself. The tea was refreshing and we left from Sangama at 730 post refreshments.View of SangamaImage courtesy Jisto and cover picture courtesy GoogleDay 1BangaloreHotelsMapOur plan was to visit only Shivasamudram, and so our trip kicked off at 6 in the morning. Since Shivasamudram consists of two waterfalls that is Gaganachukki and Barachukki we set course for Gaganachukki falls initially and then Barachukki. The route which we used was via Nice Road and then we used the deviation towards Kanakpura Road to avoid traffic at Banashankeri.ShivanasamudraHotelsMapWe made a stop for breakfast; bread and nutella - a small bite en route Shivasamudrum and soon we were racing past NH948 and we reached our destination by around 1030. The ride was not boring, as we had organized some games so that this would keep us entertained. The moment we arrived, we were immediately fascinated by the waterfalls, chirping birds and the lush greenery; which encouraged everyone to clicks snaps of the place.Gaganachukki Falls View PointHotelsMapGaganachukki FallsGaganachukki FallsBarachukki Falls RoadHotelsMapWe left Barachukki Falls and it was almost 2 PM so we decided to have our lunch. We stopped near a shop which sold fried fish and oh my, they were so irresistible. It was a real treat to my taste-buds though. Also, for having fish as cheap as 120&#x20B9;, not only satisfied our stomachs but also our pockets too.Fresh fish from the riverShivanasamudraHotelsMapAt the foothills of Barachukki Falls we discovered that one could go for the coracle ride at this location. We were all excited as taking a ride on a coracle at this beautiful place would really be fascinating. The ride was priced slightly on the higher side but it was fun. The climate was slightly warm, hence we also wondered going for the ride will be really tiring but our thoughts were disproved once we stepped in. The heat started to fade away and the soothing wind on our faces made it a very relaxing ride. The coracle owners were generous enough to hand over their oars so that we could take a chance of rowing the coracle. The boat ride lasted for one and a half hours and I would definitely recommend the ride.Boating at ShivanasamudraSangama Rivers ConfluenceHotelsMapThe ride came to an end and we headed back to our mini bus, and it was still early in the afternoon hence we decided to head towards Sangama which was an unplanned event. Again - We got a chance to head out and so never wanted to waste the opportunity of utilizing it to the fullest. We reached Sangama by 5PM and at the entrance they had told very clearly that they will be closing by 6PM, nevertheless we headed onto the river banks and the sight of sunset was on our eyes.Sun In Your Eyes at SangamaBangaloreHotelsMapOur ride back to Bangalore was really exciting as our mini bus had a provision for disco lights and with good JBL speakers. All of us danced as much as we could throughout the journey and we finally reached our destination at 10 in the evening. We also had our dinner organized at our destination, post which we bid adieu to our crew and headed back home.Overall, the trip was worth the fun though our trip destination seemed less attractive we all had our bit of fun and that is exactly what mattered to us. Post this trip, we all decided that our next trip will be worthwhile going to in both aspects of fun and scenic beauty.Our crewYes! There was hardly any water, no matter the environment and views were mesmerizing and that is what actually mattered. The location of the view points were tactfully located; every angle of the waterfall can be covered with respect to a photographer. There is also a photographer at the view point, he will charge around two hundred for a picture but, it is my suggestion that you travel during the season so that your picture will be good and worthwhile.Monkeys are unavoidable",

		"Text": "Classic Itinerary for EgyptEgypt is a land of dreams. We have always heard of the enigma surrounding the Pyramids of Egypt. There is only one word to describe Egypt &#x2013; it is simply epic. Home ancient Pharaohs, Egypt is a destination with dazzling tombs and temples that awes all the visitors. Not only the historic treasures, Egypt is also known for its vast tracts of deserts, the life giving Nile and superb scuba diving destinations. History and culture, sun and sand, ancient civilisation and archaeological delights, Egypt has something for all.Temples at LuxorHaving 5 days in Egypt is not much time, but you can definitely get the essence of Egypt in this time. In such a short trip, you should start with Cairo and visit the Pyramids. Alexandria and Luxor should also be included. Here is a perfect itinerary for spending 5 days in Egypt.Muhammad Ali Mosque, Cairo\nDay 1CairoHotelsMapDay 1: Cairo &#x2013; the PyramidsThe Pyramids are what Egypt is so famous for. I have heard stories of pyramids since childhood, and to me it is one of the most intriguing places. Visit the last surviving Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramid of Giza. Built as tombs for the mighty Pharaohs and guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, Giza&apos;s pyramid complex has always has always spell bounded its visitors. If you want to inside the Great Pyramid, then visit early in the morning. In the afternoon, visit the Cairo Museum. In the evening, visit the labyrinth shopping souk of Khan el-Khalili. This is Cairo&#x2019;s grand marketplace buzzing with people all through the day.Day 2AlexandriaHotelsMapDay 2: A Day trip to AlexandriaAlexandria might not have the grand monuments like Pyramids, but is does have a great waterfront view and is a less crowded than Cairo. This pleasant sea side town overlooking the blue Mediterranean Sea has a host of delights. Visit the Citadel of Qaitbey (an imposing 15th century fort build to protect the city against the Ottomans), Alexandria National Museum, Pompeii Pillar and the New Library of Alexandria. The New Library of Alexandria or Bibliotheca Alexandria is one of the best libraries in Middle East. The library building too is an architectural delight. If you are a bibliophile like me, you would definitely want to visit this great library.AlexandriaBibliotheca AlexandrinaHotelsMapBibliotheca Alexandrina | Courtesy: WikimediaAlexandria is also known for delightful seafood at great value. Visit Kadoura, (The Fish King of Alexandria) for a good seafood meal.Day 3AswanHotelsMapDay 3: AswanTake an overnight train to arrive at Aswan. This will help you to travel across the country without losing time in the day. Aswan has a totally different vibe to the rest of the country. Sail the Nile on felucca and go and hang out with the Nubian people on Elephantine Island. You can also take a camel ride to the desert monastery of St. Simeon on the East Bank.Elephantine IslandDay 4EdfuHotelsMapDay 4: Aswan &#x2013; Luxor via Kom Ombo Temple, Edfu Temple and Esna TempleFor travelling to Luxor from Aswan, there is air-conditioned sleeper as well as ordinary Express trains. It is only a 3 to 4 hour journey. There are three other magnificent temples along the road between these two cities - Kom Ombo Temple, Edfu Temple and Esna Temple. Kom Ombo and Edfu have a railway station. If you are travelling by train, then you can stop at each station, get down and visit the temples. But it will take some time. If you want to save time, then you have to hire a car to reach Luxor.Kom Ombo TempleEdfu TempleAlternative option: If you have time, then you can avail the luxurious Nile Cruise. The cruise takes 4-5 days to complete this journey with stops at Kom Ombo Temple, Edfu Temple and Esna Temple. You can also sail by Felucca, these are cheaper than cruises.Day 5LuxorHotelsMapDay 5: LuxorLuxor is an extraordinary place. Often called as the world&#x2019;s greatest open-air museum, it is the testimony of the history of Egypt. The Nile flows between the city, Luxor is definitely a must visit in Egypt. What are the attractions at Luxor? Being the ancient and rich Thebes and the powerbase of the Pharaohs, Luxor is famous for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut. Among the best tombs are those of Ramses I, VI, VII and IX, Thutmose and Amenhotep. King Tutankhamun&#x2019;s tomb is also open for visit. While the East Bank is more vibrant with hotels, shops and markets, the West Bank is all about tombs and temples.This completes 5 days in Egypt. Luxor has an international airport and you can fly out from there.Karnak Temple | Courtesy: WikimediaValley of KingsValley of QueensBest Time to Visit EgyptThe best time to visit Egypt is mid-September to May. It is better to avoid the summers in Egypt.How safe is Egypt?Tourist attractions in Egypt are largely safe and not under any threat. Egyptians are one of the most welcoming people. Just like any other country, Egypt has its share of touts. You just have to be careful.",

		"Text": "It is monsoon time and it is raining heavily in the mountains. Almost everyone suffers with the dilemma of where to head during the monsoon season as the mountains are experiencing crazy rains, so I decided to hit the foothills of Himalayas, where there is still raining, but not so much. Infact rain makes these otherwise not so attractive foothills a delight for the eyes. I decided to head to Lansdown which I don&#x2019;t find really captivating, but a visit to this place in Monsoon changed my perception.It was super humid in Delhi when I left, it was early morning 5 O&#x2019;clock on a Saturday morning, since Lansdown is only 5 hours&#x2019; drive from Delhi there is no point of leaving on Friday night, it&#x2019;s always better you leave really early and reach Lansdown around 10 in the morning. If you are not driving you can take a bus to Kotdwar from ISBT, which are very frequent and it will take 5-6 hours and from Kotdwar Lansdown is still 1 hour away and you can easily find buses and taxis from there to Lansdown.After reaching Lansdown I checked into the GMVN guest house I had pre booked, GMVN Tip and Top Lansdown is thebest property you will find here. There have amazing tree houses, cottages and huts, it&#x2019;s a perfect place to stay if you are visiting with family.You can relax for some hours and then decide to go on and visit some of the sights of the places, namingly the St.John&#x2019;s and Mary&#x2019;s Churches, The Military Museum, Bhulla Tal. The churches are almost same like any other churches and so is the museum. Bhulla tal is a manmade lake, you will find lots of people around it mostly, but it was kind of peaceful considering this was the time of monsoon.But the best part was Tip &amp; Top and considering the accommodation was there only, you can walk up to the sunset point and watch the beautiful Sunset. The whole time I stayed there it was cloudy, you could just sit there and do nothing at all and it would still feel amazing. So close and connected to nature. If you are up for it and its not really cloudy you can get up in the morning and watch the amazing sunrise as well, but it was cloudy while I was there so couldn&#x2019;t watch the sunrise but I didn&#x2019;t regret missing it at all for those lovely clouds.Sunday after breakfast I went out to explore Tip and Top a little more and started my return journey to Delhi around 1 PM, considering some weekend I was sure to reach back delhi by 6 but I reached back by 8 PM, so not much of a hassle.Here is a perfect itinerary if you want to plan the same tripSaturday : Leave from Delhi early Morning at 5:00 and reach Lansdown by 10:00, rest and freshen up.Get ready for exploring Lansdowne, Visit the Church(st. Mary and st. John), Bhulla Lake, Army Muesuem, Mall Road and head towards Tip and Top point to watch the amazing sunset.Sunday: Have breakfast and spend some time exploring the beautiful location. 2:00 PM start Heading back to Delhi after Lunch. Reach Delhi by Night.",

		"Text": "#SILKROAD#Karakum Desert, #Turkmenistan enroute to # Khiva, #Uzbekistan\nKarakumHotelsMapKune Urgench, Karakum Desert is the last stop before the Uzbek Border starts at the far north Dasagouz Velayat (province) from Turkmenistan side. After crossing the Uzbek border outpost, I headed my way to Khiva, an ancient old town wrapped in time from the Silk Road Era. More of Khiva to follow in Part 2 of the Silk Road Travel diaries. Stay tuned in until then. From the Uzbek border, the drive to Khiva is barely an hours drive. For now, this series is about Konye Urgench and the travel photo blog of the Karakum desert.#Konye Urgench also spelled as K&#xF6;ne&#xFC;rgen&#xE7; in Turkmen is located on the banks of the Amu-Darya River. It is situated on one of the most important medieval paths: the Silk Road and has remnants of large number of some well-preserved monuments, dating from the 11th to the 16th centuries. They comprise mosques, the gates of a caravanserai, fortresses, mausoleums and minaret. Initially, it was part of the Khorezm dynasty that included part of Uzbekistan (Khiva/Urgench) and was second largest city after Bukhara. Kunya Urgench historical sites are also included into the UNESCO World Heritage List.In 1221, Genghis Khan destroyed the city in the Mongol invasion of Central Asia, in what is considered to be one of the bloodiest massacres in human history. Despite the devastating effects of the invasion, the city was revived and it regained its previous status. It was described by the 14th-century Arabic traveller Ibn Battuta as &quot;the largest, greatest, most beautiful and most important city of the Turks. (Wikipedia).The main places of interest in Kunya-Urgench, to name a few, are the mausoleum (10-14 Century) of Najmuddin Al-Kubra, the mausoleum of Mongolian princess Turabek-Khanym, the minaret of Mamun, the minaret of kutlug Timur - the highest minaret in Central Asia. The following sections is an attempt to take you back in time so that the journey is not about ticking just the bucket lists but is about immersing in the rich historical, cultural and geopolitical tapestry of the bygone era.Mausoleum of Turabek KhanumKonye-Urgench is a unique spiritual pearl of the Turkmen history and is visual, aesthetic and spiritual marvel. Its masterpieces of medieval architecture elucidates the diversity of Islamic traditions - a unique combination of architectural styles and forms, the richness of textures, designs and colourful mosaic, and the melange of geographical and cultural hotspots. Konye-Urgench is located 480 km to the north from Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan near the river Amu-Darya on the crossroad of silk trade routes. Konye-Urgench was once considered to be one of the largest cities of the Great Silk Road. The date of its foundation is unknown, but indicates to the ancient period (II-V B.C.) There were references on this city in Aveste sacred book of Zoroastrian, which was called &#x201C;Urva&#x201D; or &#x201C;Urga&#x201D;.In the middle of the VIII century the city was conquered by Arabs and was renamed and called Gurgandj.XII and beginning of XIII centuries, was the period of astounding growth of Urgench in Central Asia. Well-known thinkers of that time used to live in Urgench, such as Avicenna, Al-Beruni, and Ibn-Battut and others. In 1221, the city regarded as &quot;the heart of Islam&quot; rebelled against Genghis Khan and was destroyed by the Mongols.In the first half of the XIV century a special role in the development of the city was played by Qutlugh Temur and his wife Turabek-Khanum.The city survived destructive conquest of Amir Temur&#x2019;s army in 1388 years, and in the 16th century it had turned into a desert forcing people to leave due to change of the course of Amu Darya River. In the year 1664, after the construction of new Urgench in the territory of modern Uzbekistan, the old city was called Konye-Urgench (Old Urgench).The architecture of Turabek-Khanum&#x2019;s mausoleum is a unique combination of elegance and monumentality and gorgeous decor. The inner dome decor is a very fine mosaic works with ornaments of stars and colors, but now faded and lost in oblivion. Who and when this was built is unknown. The name of Turabek-Khanum, a Mongolian princess, was always surrounded by numerous romantic legends, the favorite daughter of the governor of Golden Horde - Uzbek-khan and the spouse of his deputy in Khoresm, Qutlugh Temur, who governed in XIX century. She became famous for constructing religious buildings. Traditionally, Turabek-Khanum was the patroness of women and girls. In XIX-XX centuries, her mausoleum was the center of mass pilgrimage for brides. They usually come here before the wedding and asked for her blessing. In the present times, the tomb of Turabek-Khanum has been the center of mass pilgrimage.There is a beautiful legend on true love. Here it goes. Turabek-Khanum inherited the throne of her father and stayed long enough unmarried, and only after persuasion of elders decided to give her heart to the chosen one. However, she is known for her temper, that nobody dared to ask her hand in marriage. Only one master Gulgardan was not afraid of declaring his feelings and promised to dedicate the finest building constructed on Earth on her name. Turabek agreed with one condition. Only if she liked the building, she will marry, otherwise he will be punished. The master constructed three times the buildings one better than the earlier one. But Turabek showed no likings for any of these buildings. She though privately agreed that Gulgardan was a talented and skilled Craftsman. The rest was a sad story. She admonished him for wasted means. Gulgardan worked hard day and night and the Mausoleum was built, which later become a tomb of Sufi Kings. The building was flabbergasting with its wealth of interior decorations and beauty of mutli color ornaments etc. However, Turabek Khanym did not fulfil her promise and instead preferred the Governor of Khoresm, Qutlug Timur. The deceived master Gulgardan could not cope with his disappointment and threw himself from the top of the Mausoleum.Gulgardan jumped, got injured badly, but did not die. Seven days his soul did not leave the body until Turabek after insistence of elders had to utter: &quot;My body belongs to you.&quot; It is said, that there is a buried place of the master in Mazar of Turabek-Khanum.Time stands witness to the mausoleum, as well as to the other unique oriental architectural mounuments of Konye-Urgench. But even today, despite the absence of the north side and the destroyed dome of the mausoleum impresses with its grandeur. Turabek-Khanum is buried inside this Mausoleum. After hearing this story, I never understood why Turabek-Khanum is a sacred place of worship. I was told she was later in life canonized and declared a Saint. If it&#x2019;s for its monumental glory, I can still see the reason.Sufi Sheikh Najmuddin Kubra.This is also well known as Sih-Kabir mazary, which literally means &quot;grave of the great sheikh.&quot; Here, according to people&#x2019;s legend, in 1221 a martyr poured the blood, died for the faith from the Mongolian horsemen. known as the founder of the Sufi Order &quot;kubraviya&quot;. He was called the &quot;Kubra&quot;, i.e., greatest of the great, close to God, a friend of God. In Gurganj or Urgench as is called now, he built khanaka (Sufi monastery) surrounded himself with numerous students. They came to him seeking the truth and greater purpose of life. According to legend, the great Sheikh, possessing miraculous power, able to predict the events anticipated and the great calamity that will come from the East and turn flourishing region in ruins.Sources also say that enemies allowed passage to Sheikh Kubra to leave the besieged Urgench. But the 76-year-old Sheikh, by picking up his sword, instead went to the battlefield. From the description of the event, made by Alisher Navoi, it is known that in one of the attacks Sheikh captured enemy&#x2019;s flag and held it so tightly that the enemy managed to take the flag only after killing him, they cut off the fingers of the saint.This place is also known to have grave yard of 360 Saints, cemetery close to the edges of flower Amu Dariya. Hence, considered as highly placed spiritual significance. A special place in the memorial complex belongs to the grave of Djamildjan - beloved disciple of Najmuddin Kubra. I hope you will enjoy the journey as much as I did and stay tuned for the part 2 of the Silk Road Travel diaries.Drive through Karakum to Gazajak, LebapTributary of Amu Dariya Chai khana (Tea House) remnants of the erstwhile silk roadGas pipeline from Turkmenistan to UzbekistanKonye-UrgenchHotelsMapMausoleum of Tyurabek KhanumMausoleum of Najmuddin Al-KubraCemetery of 100-saints adjacent to Amu DariyaShrine of Nalac BabaHopes pinned in the colourful pieces of cloths for every wish made by the worshippersDonation boxMausoleum of Gawsul Azam PakThe Caretaker of the shrineAs the sunsets over Najmuddin Al-Kubra&#x27;s Mausoleum",

Bengal of all the other regions in the country is quite popular for its belief in supernatural powers and paranormal activities. Here is a list of the most haunted places in Kolkata for travellers who are curious, who love to explore deserted places and who would go to any extent to get the adrenaline rush. Escape into the local fables of this colonial city where one can easily find historical facts intertwined with fantasies. \nNational LibraryHotelsMapNational Library is the largest library in India. Located on the Belvedere Estate in Alipore the library is claimed to be haunted. There have been several incidents which made the locals believe that this library is not just about books. The place has such a reputation that it does not even have a night guard to watch the place. Built in 1953, 65 years ago, the Library is historically significant and has colonial architecture. It still continues to operate for the public. As far as the story goes, if any of it is true, then a young Bengali researcher will make his presence feel if you don&#x2019;t keep a book at its proper place.Source: LivemintWriters BuildingHotelsMapNo, Writers&apos; Building is not a place where writers (like that of modern times) used to reside. It is a building which was built to accommodate servants, who were the then known as writers. The building was built in 1777 by East India Company in BBD Bagh, old Kolkata. The building has its own share of ghost stories. It is claimed to be a murder site of British Colonel named, N.S. Simpson, whose spirit is claimed to still haunt the place. The 150m long place is now the secretariat building of the West Bengal Government, which gets empty by 7pm in the evening every day due to the whole ghost situation.Source: IndiaTVMullick Ghat Flower MarketHotelsMapSource: HeritageGhatsofCalcuttaRight on the banks of River Ganga and just below the imperial Howrah Bridge, you will get to know some of the most nerve-racking stories of paranormal activities. This part of Ganges has seen plenty of suicides and other unnatural deaths, and it is claimed that it is the spirits of these victims, who try make their presence feel at odd hours of the day. Locals have seen hands calling for help in the water, but they can never tell if it&#x2019;s real. So, if you are planning to visit this place early in the morning, make sure to have few locals around you to guide you.South Park Street CemeteryHotelsMapSource: EventsHighBuilt-in 1767, in the Mother Teresa Sarani, South Park Street Cemetery is one of the oldest non-church cemeteries in India and is one of the famous tourist spots in the city. However, one should be careful of clicking pictures here. It&#x2019;s a graveyard after all. There are many stories of creepy shadows passing by and other paranormal activities. There have been instances when pictures have turned out to be blurry. Many people claim that they have heard strange noises at odd hours from the cemetery. Further, the locals say that you can actually fall sick if you visit the cemetery. So, visit at your own risk!Rabindra Sarobar Metro StationHotelsMapSource: MetroEasyKolkata is the first city in the whole of South Asia to get an underground metro line. Almost all the stations of this metro line are rumoured to be haunted. Still, people claim to experience some serious paranormal activities in this particular station on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road. Once the last train of the day departs, some have seen figures walking on the tracks. Rabindra Sarobar Metro Station has seen many suicides and maybe that is why people tend to believe the stories that travel around.Putulbari Heritage HouseHotelsMapSource: DailySocialPutulbari is a local name given to a warehouse which literally means dollhouse. It is located in Ahritola, Kolkata. The place was a commercialised area for its location near the ghats. The building gained its nickname from a statue designed on the top of the building. A mere sight of an old building with trees growing on its walls and doll designs can give you real chills. The place is currently resided by a family, who doesn&#x2019;t allow trespassing at any cost. As far as the story of this place goes, this warehouse was also used as a centre to exploit women. It is considered that the spirits of these women still roam around this place seeking revenge.Race CourseHotelsMapSource: IndiaTodayPopularly known as the race course, the horror story of this place is as elitist as it can get and goes back to the 1930s. It is considered that this place is haunted by a white horse named Pride who was shot right after it lost a race. The horse belonged to a racing enthusiast George William, who allegedly shot him because he lost a fortune in the race. It is said that people have seen the white horse riding on the race course, and your chances of witnessing the same might increase on Saturdays.So, all you brave hearts out there, if you want to explore Kolkata&apos;s another side, dive deep into the past and make your trip all the more exciting, then let go of all your fears and visit these haunted sites, but all at your own risk!Have you ever been to any of the haunted sites before?

		"Text": "Do you have a definition in your mind for an &quot;epic&quot; day? What if I told you about a day you explored one of the longest caves in the world that is open to public and trekked at a giant canyon with a breath-taking view? Wouldn&apos;t that be one epic day in your travel journal? No, you don&apos;t need a visa to go see these places, they are right here in India, in the state of Andhra Pradesh. If you live near Hyderabad, Chennai or Bangalore, you might not even need a vacation to visit these unsung natural wonders of the world, all you need is a weekend and wanderlust. The reason I include both of these in my #offbeat destination travelogue is because they are just 65 km apart and there is no reason why you should miss one if you come all the way to visit the other.Gandikota - The Grand Canyon of IndiaGandikota is a village named after the Gandikota fort, a 14th century fort that was established during the powerful Pemmasani Dyanasty. The fort in turn, got it&apos;s name from the peculiar landscape formed by the Pennar river cutting through the Erramala Hills forming a giant gorge. The word Gandikota literally translates into the &quot;Gorge Fort&quot; (&quot;Gandi&quot; in Telugu means gorge and &quot;Kota&quot; means fort).Things to do at GandikotaExplore the ruins Watch the episodes of medieval history unfold infront of you as you walk into the Gandikota fort and the major structures within the fortified village which includes the following-Ruins of the Gandikota FortTwo temples dedicated to Madhhava and RanganathaThe second temple with incredibly beautiful sculpturesThe mosque at Gandikota called Jama Masjid ; Photo Credits: Praveen Kumar (Flickr)The dreadful prison now inhabited by batsWatch the sunrise or sunsetDepending on what time you reach, this is an excellent spot to welcome the morning Sun or bid the Sun goodbye. So, time your visit accordingly if this is a day-trip.Hike down to the riverThe Pennar river cutting through the granite mountain is a sight to behold in the monsoon when the river actually exists and the weather is relatively cool. In summer the river would have dried up leaving a marshland in the gorge.Camp at nightImagine camping in this location, looking at the clear star-studded sky at night and waking up to the golden sunrise. They have organised camping facility, where they would provide you with tents at Gandikota, but you can bring your own tent and plant it there for a night.Photo Courtesy: Flickr photostream by Arnab Phani\nAndhrapradesh tourism Belum caves unitHotelsMapBelum CavesNext #offbeat spot for this trip is the longest cave open to public in south-east Asia , which is a natural cave and estimated to be millions of years old. It was known to local villagers for ages but was first explored by H.D GeBeauyer, a German caver and his team in 1982- 1984. (Source: Belum Caves authority). The pristine white statue of Gautam Buddha outside is hard to miss, and is indeed a landmark to signal that you are now very close to your destination, Belum caves.The pristine white Buddha Statue near Belum CavesIt&apos;s a great place to tickle your curiosity bone - imagine that this pace has witnessed the human evolution. It is surprising at how well-maintained the caves are with the interiors well-lit and well-ventilated for safety of tourists.You have to enter the caves yourself to experience the thrill of cave exploration but here are some of the most outstanding spots in the Belum caves- (I don&apos;t know what their real names are, so I decided to name them myself).The great bath-tub The bath and many for sculptures here suggest that the cave had been discovered centuries agoThe Squeeze-past challengeHow do you think these groves were formed on the walls?The Blue LagoonThe caves are &quot;Lit&quot; - literally and figurativelyThe Watch-ya-headThat&#x27;s a name and a note of cautionLast bummer - The Upside-DownThe real upside down from Stranger Things :)Places to stayNow comes the logistics part, and this is one department that this place is not very strong at. The only place to stay is the Haritha Resorts , a residence owned and operated by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department, located at a 3-minute walking distance from the Gandikota Fort. The resort is designed to look like a fort and has AC rooms and dormitory to accommodate all type of travelers. Due to high demand on weekends and holidays the booking needs to be done at least 3 weeks in advance any time of the year. If you are on a vacation, choose weekdays for a stay in this resort. They serve simple but good quality vegetarian food and has very neatly kept rooms with all modern amenities. The tariff of AC rooms is less than Rs. 2000 so keep your expectations realistic. The highlight of the stay would be spending the evening on the rooftop.Places to eatThis is another department where Gandikota and Belum caves is likely to disappoint you. There is hardly any place to have a wholesome lunch except in the Haritha Resort itself. There is a Haritha hotel at Belum Caves which served refreshments, but not an option for a proper meal. So if you decide to camp here you have to bring some food along or just live on snacks throughout the day. That&apos;s not such a bad idea for one day.Distance from Major cities in South IndiaHyderabad -&gt; Gandikota : 388kmChennai -&gt; Gandikota : 381kmBangalore -&gt; Gandikota : 280kmDisclosure: All photos are taken by the author unless otherwise mentioned in the caption.

		"Text": "The party capital of India has more to offer than just clubs and crowded beaches. Arambol Beach is one destination either left unknown by the tourists or is not visited often for being too far from the hip Calungute and Baga. We discovered this hidden gem, while mingling with locals hoping to experience something different during our sixth time visit to Goa. Usually habituated to stick to only the night clubs till the early hours of dawn and laze around in shacks, being a glutton, most of the day, we needed a break from this monotony. We chose to take an hour journey in sweltering heat riding the bike covered head to toe to this unknown destination.This place is not what you say easy to find. Carry your GPS to reach the destination, park your bike and a 30-35 mins trek will finally lead you to it. Don&#x2019;t forget to keep asking for directions or taking a break, as you pass along shops and cafe&apos;s built on the narrow trekking roads. \nArambol BeachHotelsMapArambol beach overlooking the Sweet Water LakeCafe&#x27;s to laze around at Arambol BeachWe took a half an hour break for lunch and walked through the scorching sand thereafter. You finally start to see the thick jungle and nestled in between the Arambol Sweet Water Lake, a fresh water lagoon, overlooking the Arambol beach. One of the best beaches in Goa unexploited by tourist, and a must visit if you are looking for solitude.The lake originates from a natural hot-spring within the Goan jungle. It is surrounded by coconut groves and green hills. You can dip your feet or bathe in the lagoon. Natural formed clay, seen around the lake is believed to have magical healing powers. Coat the clay all over on your body and wait for it to dry off and then remove it by bathing in the lake. Water will be warm as it is originates from a hot spring. We bathe and purchased some more from the locals who will grind the blocks of clay for you to take back home for a minimal price.Arambol Sweet Water LakeHotelsMapYou can also meditate under the Great Banyan tree which is located inside the jungle and align your chakras within.Dipping in the lagoon and taking in the feeling of intoxication which comes with the scenic beauty, calmness and the serenity of this magical place, this destination should be on your &quot;to-do&quot; list on your next visit to Goa.",

It was one of the best time we visited reason as it was raining &amp; foggy. The temperature was about 16-17 degrees. At night it was too cold. We reached panchgani in the afternoon &amp; rested for few hours. We stayed at Zostel. Amazing place &amp; view was just breath taking overlooking the Krishna Valley. Evening we went to Table Land, Sydney Point. Could not click more photos since it was too cold &amp; raining. At one point it was too foggy that I could not even see my car on table land. Next day we checked out &amp; headed to new Mapro garden which comes on way to Mumbai. Mapro used shipping containers this time to stuff their products. Different colors were painted on each shipping containers. It was looking too good. July August is the best time to visit Panchgani. Make sure you carry umbrellas &amp; jacket. The trip came to end on 5th August 2018. It was one of the most memorable trip. Looking forward to visit Panchgani again this December as Panchgani Festival is going to be held.",

This is about the Himalayas. This is about the journey. This is about fascination, and peace. \nDay 1KathgodamHotelsMapThe road starts innocently enough. Climbing up the mountain gently, sleepily. Or maybe it&apos;s sleepy after the train journey. The road beckons you up, but not too much. You can still turn back.You haven&apos;t been enchanted yet. There is still the city air to breath. You have your ties. You are looking forward to the trip ahead, but a part of you is still thinking about your home, about the goings on the city.And, then the road turns, and things start falling off from you. Clean air. Fresh smells. Blowing wind. Whipping round your hair. You can take a deep, deep breath in. Your companions fall silent. You fall silent. Having a conversation is pointless, seeing that all we talk about is petty, meager.You&apos;ve seen it before, felt it before, but the parts of your mind affected each time is different. You feel it every time, in every which way. The mountains are changing, every moment, they grow, they pulsate, they grow on you. They start looming over the road. Grand monoliths, standing eons before we started crawling, growing taller each passing second.LohaghatHotelsMapYou climb a few hundred meters. The ranges open up. The gorge beside the road deepens. The grass turns browner. The leaves more spiked. The mountains behind start to spread apart, showing an impression of the distance all the way to the very beginning. Beginning of all life. The land of the Gods. The Himalayas.Khaliya TopHotelsMapThe car steadily climbs on. You try to keep every sight, every emotion, safely stored, remembered in your heart, in your camera. To write now. To write after.There are memories of previous such climbs. Of such journeys. You recall them. There are glimpses of trees you&apos;ve passed before, stones you&apos;ve seen, bridges you&apos;ve crossed. The cars behind you turn off to other places, humans going away. Roads carrying them away to the places where they are meant to be.You take the right turn.Civilization now is not buildings meant to sell, houses here are just to live. Villages are spread apart as much as the vista has opened up. Shoulders of the road just beyond the left tires, shoulders of the mountains now of full-grown giants&apos;. Rank upon rank of sons. All facing up to the elders.At first you don&apos;t notice Her. You are looking at eye level. There are the sons. You haven&apos;t seen the mother. She is there. Behind them all. A brooding, looming, ever-presence. Your glance never leaves her ever. But that is preposterous, impertinent even. You don&apos;t look, you are looked at.Day 2PithoragarhHotelsMapShe looks at you, in you, through you. No one ever escaped her, nor will. She is going to keep seeing, unmoved, when we have destroyed ourselves. She has seen us grow into the monsters we are. She doesn&apos;t cry. Her family is unfeeling. But in their presence, you feel.Day 3Munsyari - Thal RoadHotelsMapYou are awed. You are elevated. You want to bow. The higher Himalayas, the Himalayas, will make you want to cry. Cry for joy. Bitter tears of shame for ever doubted that there&apos;s no one for you. Exalted laughter. Sweet tears roll away because you understand now that your fears, though seemingly real down in the city, actually is nothing in the scale of life, in the vast way nature exists. The peak stares unblinkingly down at you. You expect at least a smile, all you&apos;ll get is stony reflections of the Sun.The higher you go, the road is deserted. For hours, yours is the only car going either way. Roads scratched onto the sides of the giants. Roads which won&apos;t exist after the next rains. Or just a tiny shrug.Her shoulders widen out. You see her majesty increase after each turn of the road. The climb is steeper. The air, rarer. But it&apos;s not poison. It is peace. It is life. She is there. Always. Everywhere.Day 4MunsyariHotelsMapWhen you reach the town, you know that it is there in honor of the ranges beyond. The town is not nestled in her lap. The town exists because they allow it to be. All you know is humans are just too small to mean anything to the snow laden walls of rock. Absolute walls. You never think of crossing them. Because they never diminish in size. You climb one, you see the next, and others, shrouded in snow, in mist, in permafrost. A wrinkled plane stretching away till your eyes see no more. A plane of death for mortals. Serenity.This morning, she has covered herself in clouds. The clouds do not move. They call others to cover up the whole range. Peaks lost high into the clouds, in preparation for the coming winters.Day 5MunsyariHotelsMapDay 6MunsyariHotelsMapYou try and imagine the cold up there. The life, the field of energy there. No human is alive up there. The energy is too much for us to bear. The Himalayas are majestic living beings. You feel the immense amount of energy emanating, reaching out, flowing over you, burning through you as you glance up.You stand up to the mountains, human that you are. But you can&apos;t measure up. You leave. Aware of your existence, aware of your tininess. You have to come back to land which is familiar, un-threatening.Coming down, you remember her. You feel her presence. She is still presiding over the land. Looking away to the South. She is with you. She was with you. You remember how she stroked your hair. You remember how you fell asleep on her shoulder, how she slept beside you. You remember. You feel her. And you want her closer, to be more real. She is always there beside you, behind you. Just beyond the next turn. Always there to offer a place to you.And I&apos;m on the train back to Delhi. A place where everything now seems crass. An anti-place. Anti existence. An affront to the Himalayas. A slight to the Elder Gods.",

Staying among the hustle and bustle of Delhi like many of its dweller sometimes I really need a short getaway in between the long holiday trips.So last week I headed to Alwar, and planned to visit Siliserh Lake which is about 15 km away from the main city.The lake is located in a really picturesque site and its terrace restaurant offer visitors a refreshing scenic view of the lake. A family picnic spot, with a plethora of water sports like boating, jet skiing, sightseeing and many other things at affordable prices. Bollywood&apos;s famous movie &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; has been shot here, one of the main attractions of Alwar. There is also a heritage hotel with lousy staff and fine food as it is managed by Rajasthan Tourism, so service is average. There are a lot of monkeys in surrounding place which gives an added adventure. I was lucky I get to see clouds the day I visited the lake, the sunset was so majestic with the alluring shades of sky. The lake is so huge with hills on all sides. It was so secluded and statue still with the calmness while watching a mob of flies rose into the air. The reservoir is still a hidden gem so the good thing is the whole ambience is really tranquil and is not crowded with masses of visitors. But there is no easy way to reach there by public transport. There are small jeeps plying within the city called &apos;Alwar Vahini&apos; so one can hire them to heading to the Siliserh Lake, the charges are also pocket friendly.Location- Siliserh Lake, Alwar, Rajasthan, IndiaTimings- 5:00 am to 7:00 pmEntry Fee- Rs.100 on Weekends &amp; Rs.50 on Weekdays(which can be redeemed for tea/coffee/soft drink or snacks)https://www.instagram.com/theexploringbeauty/?hl=enPanoramic view of the lakePhotographer and Traveller View all posts by The Exploring Beauty",

		"Text": "You Never Forget Your First Time Wednesday, September 2, 2015, 10 PM: The end of a particularly bad day saw me at a friend&apos;s party bemoaning the amount of work I had and how it wasn&apos;t what I thought I&apos;d end up doing. The patient ear listening to me asked what it was that I wanted to do. &quot;I just want to travel and write!&quot; I&apos;d cried.Friday, September 11, 2015 3 PM: I walked through the Arrivals gate at the Delhi airport, waiting for the friend who was to drive me into town. I was to be dropped off at Connaught Place, where I had to rendezvous with a group people with whom I would be setting off on a two week road trip to and through the magnificent Ladakh.My best guess till today is that had I asked for anything at all at that moment, I would have gotten it. I shall forever be glad that this is what I asked for.Visiting Ladakh, one of the largest and least inhabited districts in India and possibly the world, was akin to going back in time. The mountains, rock formations and water bodies that surround you seem like a wise, imperious old man. An old man who has lived through every age our planet has witnessed and has millions of stories to tell, if you listened carefully. The lack of greenery creates an illusion of the air being at a standstill, but step out of your car and you would be taken aback by the sheer velocity of the winds that can literally cut through rock.Our itinerary was impressive; Delhi&#x200A;-&#x200A;Manali&#x200A;-&#x200A;Jispa&#x200A;-&#x200A;Leh&#x200A;-&#x200A;Turtuk&#x200A;-&#x200A;Hundar&#x200A;-&#x200A;Pangong&#x200A;-&#x200A;Leh&#x200A;-&#x200A;Kargil&#x200A;-&#x200A;Srinagar&#x200A;-&#x200A;Delhi. Even now, when the trip is done with, I still cannot believe I actually visited all these places.Here I&apos;d like to let you in on a little secret, before this trip the farthest I have ever been northward was Chandigarh. My never having seen mountains ever before soon became a point of fascination and wonder as to how Ladakh would look to an absolute first timer.From the lush greens and gushing rivers of Manali to the drive through Jispa and camping in a field next to the home stay, from star studded nights to my first ever shooting star sighting, from roads that put our cities to shame (the Border Road Organisation or &apos;BRO&apos;, really rocks) to stretches that actually caused bruises with the amount we were tossed about inside each car, from inconceivable rock formations and bluest waters to my first snow fall and taste of snow, plucking fruits off trees and eating wai wai in a tent in a middle of nowhere &apos;town&apos; Pang...everything I experienced had my incredulity growing by the second.The cold I measured in the number and thickness of the gloves I bought. Dras, the three highest passes in the world&#x200A;-&#x200A;Tanglang La, Chang La, Khardung La, Kargil, Turtuk&#x200A;-&#x200A;one of the last Indian villages in that direction... they were all checked off my list!Don&apos;t get me wrong, as a first timer there were times when I thought the cold was going to do me in or I was most definitely going to slip off this hill. But the trick is to respect the nature around you and give in to it, and you would do just fine.Though it&apos;s not easy, try you must. Because, you will return with a lot more than memories. I returned with clarity, peace, a lot of calm, purpose, and a decision about how life, at least mine, should be lead. There&apos;s only one way to find out what you could return with.",

It has 30 tombs out of 61 monuments listed by Department of Archaeology. Aug 11 2018 (Saturday) 11:00 AM A Rainy day, I started from Hyderabad (Golconda) on my R15 with just 500 rs to spend. The total journey is of 300kms. The challenge is get back by 6 PM. Route Map Shankarpalli - Sangareddy - Sadashivpet - Zaheerabad - Bidar. The ride is pretty decent with awesome climate and great highways. My first stop is at &quot;Dargah Hazrath Nemat Ullah Shah kirmani&quot; It is just outside the City followed by&quot; &quot;Bahamani Tombs&quot;Both the places very peaceful and beautiful. A spent around an hour and left to Bidar Fort. One of the best places I have ever been. The place whispers many stories silently. Leave all your distractions and pay attention. It made me realize how beautiful the history was and how dynamic the Kingdom was. Done for the day I stopped at a Tea Stall on my return journey ate a plate of Bhajji and the Chai &#x1F496;. Total expenses 470 petrol + 30 rs Snacks.Challenge Done. &#x1F60E; Coming to my conception the Tombs has become my Death Goal. It felt like the Celebration of Death.

The hike takes around three-four hours to reach with hand full of steep trails, depending on your health and speed. Around there you can spend a day or two in the few backpacker guesthouses and homestays.Rasol spreads magic with its beauty and you will see every second person spinning wool. Commoners have given it the name as Magic Valley of Himachal. It is second to Malana in terms of Charas production. The village is a must for all those backpackers who wants to experience the magic from the Rasol cream or super cream. For others the hike and the guest house view make this village worth visiting while in Parvati Valley.Rasol is a village that is gaining fast popularity. A few years ago, Kasol was considered an off-beat destination far from the crowds of other places. But Kasol has since gained plenty of fame and is much commercialized than before; which is what makes Rasol an enticing option.",

Spiti Valley is a place that can surely leave you spell bound by its charismatic natural beauty and the Road to Spiti Valley is not far behind in decorating the entire trip with such beauty. There are two routes that goes to Spiti Valley,i) via Manali as Manali &#x2013; Rohtang Pass &#x2013; Gramphu &#x2013; Chattru &#x2013; Kunzum Pass &#x2013; Kaza (Spiti Valley)ii) via Shimla &#x2013; Kinnaur Valley as Shimla &#x2013; Kinnaur &#x2013; Nako &#x2013; Sumdo &#x2013; Tabo &#x2013; Kaza(Spiti Valley), commonly known as Hindustan &#x2013; Tibet Highway.Going via Manali side by and large depends first upon opening of Rohtang Pass and then opening of route from Gramphu to Kunzum Pass and Kunzum Pass in itself. This generally takes time and remains closed for almost 7 months in an year. Rohtang Pass generally opens post Mid &#x2013; May and further route to Kaza over Kunzum Pass almost opens by second week of June only.The Hindustan &#x2013; Tibet highway remains open all through out the year via Kinnaur Valley and you can make a journey to Kaza over it all round the year because there is no high mountain pass that comes on this route. It is said to be motorable all round the year, however, traveling to Spiti Valley especially in winter months is not that easy as it reads and conditions in winters on Hindustan &#x2013; Tibet highway is quite challenging and tough.I took this route, the Hindustan &#x2013; Tibet Road which is popularly known as one of the most adventurous and deadliest roads in the world overlapping the majority of traditional silk route and running alongside of National Highway &#x2013; 22 (NH &#x2013; 22). The road trip over Hindustan &#x2013; Tibet Road running through some of the remotest and magnificent vistas is something hard to ever forget in one&#x2019;s life. In certain stretches NH22 (the old Hindustan-Tibet Road) is terrible, but what makes up for this is the gorgeous landscape that changes as one drives through the lush mountains of Kinnaur Valley and crosses into the rugged moonscape of Spiti with just a few villages in between.This video is about the road trip from Reckong Peo(Kinnaur) to Kaza(Spiti Valley).My travel route:Delhi - Shimla &#x2013; Reckong Peo(Kinnaur) &#x2013; KAZA(SPITI VALLEY) &#x2013; Rohtang Pass - Manali - Delhi.",

		"Text": "Lava/ volcanic eruption&amp;nbsp;Dhosi HillHotelsMapAs a traveler, I have always wanted to explore places and I have always been curious. But this time, the reality hit me hard. I used to study Geology at Narnaul college back in 2010. I was told that the area around Narnaul is geologically rich, full of several minerals and ores. There is a hill by the name Dhosi and the name was used as a funny phrase in local conversation like to kya hua, &apos;tu to aise kah raha h jaise dhosi ka pahad ho&apos;. Well, I have always thought why this hill grabs attentions. The name may sound funny but what&apos;s the story behind. Finally, the detective in me kicked me hard and I packed my bag.This track leads to the summit A View from the topShiv KundSome Interesting Facts about Dhosi HillThere are 7 volcanoes in India. Dhosi Hill is one of them.It is an extinct volcano.Dhosi Hill Narnaul belongs to Aravali Range and is a part of Precambrian Malani Ingenious rock.It is located at an elevation of 1170m.It is located at 900 ft above the sea level.It dates back to 732 Ma BP (million years before present).The lava and crater is still there.There is a fort which was built by Hemu.This place has several medicinal plants.There are temples, wild animals, caves and forest.It is said that Chyavan Rishi used to live here.Pandawas are said to have come here during their time of exile.Lava and crater can still be seen hereDhosi Hill is shared by two States - Location of the HillDhosi hill is actually located at the border of Haryana and Rajasthan. Thus Dhosi village of Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan and Kultajpur &amp; Thana village of Mahendergarh, Haryana share the hill. And the hill is now in control of the village panchayat of these three villages. The hill is located in Dhosi village. There are three waterfalls which become active during the rain. These three villages are located at the bottom of the hill on either sides.Hills in the surrounding areaThe main entrance to the summit A well to store rain waterTemple at the summitHills in the surrounding areaThis hill is the origin place of ChyawanprashChyawanprash is an ancient Ayurvedic medicine which we all consume mostly during winters. It keeps our immunity strong. It is said that Ashwini Kumar brothers prepared this medicine for Chyawan Rishi. He used to live at Dhosii Hill in his ashram. And this is how it was named. This place is now a famous pilgrimage place and there are ancient temples. Dhosi Hill is an extinct volcanoThere are seven volcanoes in India. There are two in Haryana and this is one of them. The lava and volcanic eruption is still available there. It is a part of Aravali range and belongs to Precambrian malani suite of rocks which dates back to 732 Ma BP(million years before present). This extinct volcano is now a pilgrimage site and people come here for worship.Pandavas came here during exileIt is said that when Pandavas were serving their punishment of exile, they came here at this place. There are some rock which has very strange formations. It is said that these rocks have their foot impression. One rock has a big sized impression which is said to be foot impression of Bheem.This is said to be the footprints ofThere is a fort which is more than 500 years oldHemu built a fort around this hill in order to secure this place from muslim invaders. The ruins of the fort are still found there. There are thick walls, fortification and gates.There are natural caves at Dhosi HillDhosi Hill being an extinct volcano, has several natural caves. Earlier, these caves were used. One of the caves was used by Chyawan Rishi for meditation.A saint lost in meditation Dhosi Hill has a complete ecosystemDhosi Hill has its ecosystem. It has it&apos;s own flora and fauna. There are shrubs, herb, big trees, several reptiles, wild animals etc. The water is collected in reservoir during rain.How to reach Dhosi Hill?The main starting point is Narnaul. You have to reach Narnaul bus stand and from there you need to come to Honda Chowk. There you will get autoriksha to Dhosi. It is around 10 KM away from Narnaul and will hardly take 15 to 20 minutes.Things to keep in mind - Best time to visit Dhosi HillDhosi Hill is at Rajasthan - Haryana border. So, the temperature remains high here. Best time is to visit after August till February and March. To reach to the summit, you need to do trekking and the height is very steep, so this may trouble you if you are not used to it. Carry enough water as there are no shops on the way. Also, carry food as well. Make sure that you come down by 4:30PM as after this,, you will not get any vehicle back to Narnaul or better if you have your own vehicle. So, your phone may lose network at the top. (I had airtel and it lost network at the top).Places to Stay - Places to Eat At Dhosi, you will find small shops which can provide you snacks and cold drinks. The main city is Narnaul and all the good restaurants and hotels are located in Narnaul.",

Its based near backwaters of khadakwasla amid lush greenery. Its around 28 kms drive from Pune. Rutugandh resort is best for a weekend stay with your family or friends. The resort is managed itself by the owners i.e, Mr. Gandhi &amp; Mrs. Gandhi. They welcome you with a warm gesture in their home. So depending on your family members you can opt for a Single room for 2 persons , duplex flat for 4 persons , 2bhk bunglow for 6 and 3 bhk bunglow for max 12 persons. In our case we were a family for 4 so we went for duplex bunglow which you can see below. The resort serves only vegetarian food and that is its specialty and not a down point because some of you might be thinking a resort with no Non-veg cuisine :P . The food served here is pure authentic and finger licking.http://www.rutugandhresort.com/Do follow my blog to stay updated about some nice travel plans and destinations.https://www.tripoto.com/profile/bhuvneshnigamYou can have a look of the snaps of the resort for a better idea.Duplex apartmentGardenInside duplex bunglowSwimming pool2 bhk bunglowRelaxing arenaParkIsnt the background jawdrappingHave a closer look :PMusic by the poolBokeh!!Khadakwasla dam",

The ride to your resort will surely be a memorable one. Relax at your resort in the evening and get set for the many adventures and fun-filled moments planned for you in the next two weeks.Day 2MaléHotelsMapStart your day early with a nice tropical breakfast and make a beeline for Mal&#xE9; Hukuru Miskiy, or Mal&#xE9; Friday Mosque. Being the oldest, largest and most ornate mosque in the country, it has over the years become a symbol for the same.Credit: Wikimedia CommonsNext, visit the National Museum, home to many valuable archives, and the architectural marvel of the Islamic Centre.Also spend some moments praying for the Tsunami victims as you visit the Tsunami Monument in Mal&#xE9;.For dinner, head to the basic Newport restaurant or the extravagant Seagull Caf&#xE9; House for international cuisine.

The ride is a beautiful one with dolphin sightings if you&#x2019;re lucky. Among the smallest Maldivian islands accessible to public, Fulidhoo is unlike any other island. The typical water bungalows, infinity pools, overwater spas et al can&#x2019;t be found here. Instead, here you can experience the calmness of a stroll on the beach, the serenity of a quiet island inhabited by very few people, the warmth of staying at a guesthouse with locals and other such simple pleasures of life.Day 10FulidhooHotelsMapReserve this day for bucket list worthy adventures at the beach as Fulidhoo Island has some of the best diving spots.Get up close and personal with nurse sharks as you go diving.This is because it is less crowded (you&#x2019;ll often be the only ones diving there) and because Vaavu Atoll boasts of Alimatha House Reef dive site, popular for nurse sharks, stingrays and more. It is also among the few diving sights that offer good sightings throughout the year.Day 11Conrad Maldives Rangali IslandHotelsMapAs they say, always save the best for the last. Your last few days in the Maldives will be all about a luxe living, relaxation, exotic experiences and everything glamorous. This is what Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is all about. No trip to Maldives is complete without staying at the resort, twice voted Best Hotel in the World.Spend the last 4 days of your trip walking through secret gardens that you&#x2019;ve read about in books, stunning plunge pools, private beaches, lots of natural beauty and the most exceptional dining experience underwater.Don&#x2019;t forget to reserve a slot for dinner at the world&#x2019;s first undersea restaurant, Ithaa. Indulge in local flavours as you enjoy views of the coral garden and explore exquisite marine life in the Indian Ocean.There are countless water sports to keep you busy at the resort. Even a day will not be enough to try out the various activities, such as catamaran sailing, kayaking, jet skiing, water skiing, paddle boarding, wind surfing and wake boarding.The less adventurous folks can head for the glass-bottom boat ride, which offers many fun-filled moments and photo opportunities.

		"Text": "View from the Gellért Hill in BudapestResembling every year, we were planning for our tour destination this year as well. I along with my travel partner, my husband is a kind of gallivanter, provided our pockets are slightly balanced. Post length of deliberation, this time we unequivocally kept our travel destination. The dream destination for many and so was ours. Yeah, Europe it is. But we restricted ourselves towards the most sought after countries and choose four of the offbeat track locations for the eight days&#x2019; tour.Limited facility and connectivity, Guwahati had very little for us to ease the trip. From Visa to board a flight to the travel destination, we went through some of the fresh experience which needs both time, patience and money to pass through. Yet, the ecstasy we felt was much more that kept us busy with numerous research and plans till the day of our travel. First ever trip to the world which we just read and heard of, can&#x2019;t be expressed in words but the amount of elation felt till the day prior to our flight and throughout the trip was never felt before. \nBratislavaHotelsMapThe first step in Bratislava was a moment of magic. Capital of Slovakia, Bratislava embraced us with its basket of uniqueness and surprise for the next two days in the city. Situated in the bank of river Danube, Bratislava is surrounded by vineyards and the little Carpathian Mountains with the Bratislava Castle as the main attraction. The charismatic view of the town and the river from the eloquently built castle gratified our senses. Hlavne namestie literally means the Main Square located in the old town is the place which can never satisfy you even after spending the day. Colours, Music, food, drinks and dance, bustling in the small town is where you are bound to vow yourself for a visit again to this gorgeous town. One must prepare the taste buds, to adjust the drastic variation it brings in compared to the Asian food. Fresh fruit and veggies along with loads of meat and fish with potato sides were all that we tried during the days of our stay in the Slovak city. We took as much of memories we could and moved to our next destination, Budapest.BudapestHotelsMapWe were enthralled to experience the stunning capital of Hungary. The cruise along the river Danube with the audio guide took us through the history of the surrounding of the river was quite enchanting. The views of the hill Buda and the plain Pest can best be felt from the river which has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some of the notable monuments we pleased to our eyes during the cruise includes the gorgeous Hungarian Parliament, Buda castle, Fishermen&#x2019;s Bastion, Gresham Palace, Mathias Church and the Liberty Statue. We tried not to miss even the slightest of thing and captured every possible moment in our minds during the city tour. The panoramic view from St. Stephen&#x2019;s Basilica was marvellous. The first monsoon droplets at 96-metre-high made the whole mood so romantic that we stood still for hours together singing with the rain and the breeze to venerate the unfolded celestial realm. Nicknamed as Capital of Freedom the city never sleeps. Nights were as beautiful and colourful as the day was and we couldn&#x2019;t afford to miss either of it. Such energy the city bestowed upon us. We hopped and sang and strode through the city. The city has some of the best caf&#xE9; houses and food to not depress the taste buds. The goose liver and chicken paprika as the ethnic cuisine of country made our taste buds a try in Szazeves restaurant, a century old restaurant of the city is something one ought to try.Czech RepublicHotelsMapWrapping some of the best memories from Budapest we headed to the city of hundred spires, capital of Czech Republic, the gorgeous Prague. Voyaged through the roads, the maize field and the tiny houses made us feel what developed nations means and what advances the world discussed about. At times I turned around my partner to ask if the vehicles had horns for I couldn&#x2019;t hear even the slightest of honk throughout my eight days. The houses are scattered and sparsely populated. On the way to Prague we entered a village named Lednice in South Moravia in the Czech Republic. A village it is; and I was astonished to see the arrangement the small village has in itself. More than the Lednice palace and the park which is the largest in the country covering 200 square, the village in itself is a place to sit back relax with some fried cheese, juicy burger or the delicious pastries if one has a sweet tooth.More one says, the less it is; the excitement to witness the beautiful Prague kept on lingering in our mind throughout the whole course until we actually stepped in the city. Truly divine was our first feel to the golden city of Prague. Prospered by the gothic, baroque and renaissance era the city has brilliant architectural splendour. The moderate summers made the tour relaxing; energising us to feel the quixotic moment. We had early supper and went for a night walk to experience the work of art, the Charles Bridge. The pedestrian bridge crosses the Valtava river is one among the top attraction in the city. We experienced the grandiose view walking through the city from the Prague Castle through the Charles bridge to the old town square amidst the vineyard and the fruit junction. The day was filled with the crazy stuffs, food, poses for photographs and a vintage car ride. At the fall of the day we delighted ourselves amidst the tradition. Folklore garden took as savouring the countries traditional meal with live musical performance. Prague known for its Bohemia crystal brings out country&#x2019;s best crafts and products which definitely one can&#x2019;t miss out. The popular brand Bata was founded 123 years ago in Czech Republic. Thanks to it. Personally I am a big fan of Bata shoe wear. Including Cesky Krumlove as an addition, to the itinerary can never dishearten you, rather make you feel the gift of nature with heartiest thanks to the tour agency. Tales of the White lady has field all the major castles and palaces of the town. We got drenched in rain but that didn&#x2019;t stop us from exploring the hilly terrain of the place. Pork knuckle, clay oven pizzas to name few are some of the indigenous cuisines to be tried during the visit to Cesky. The two days spent in each location was an exploration to keep space for a comeback.SalzburgHotelsMapWe were a bit tired but the excitement in us was live and awake craving for newer places to explore. I couldn&#x2019;t believe my eyes, I landed in the shooting location of my favourite film &#x201C;the sound of music&#x201D; and it&#x2019;s for real the hills are still alive with the sound of music. Salzburg, the city of music housed Mozart, a prolific composer and an influential composer of classical era. Fabulously painted in white, I could feel how amazing the place would look during the snowy winters. With narrow streets and cosy lanes, it&#x2019;s by order to opt cycles over cars in the roads of Salzburg, which highlighted the beauty many fold. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the Mozart museums, the Getreidegasse and Hellbrunn Palace are among Salzburg&#x2019;s most popular locations. A funicular ride gives an easy access to the Hohensalzburg Fortress from the old town. Once we reached the fortress, we were amazed at the gorgeous eastern Alps that we couldn&#x2019;t resist but to sit back with some cosy drinks and munch to enjoy the picturesque view of the Alps. One with a love for a bird&#x2019;s eye view must never miss out the fortress on the visit to the city.ViennaHotelsMapAnd we reached the final destination of our stupendous trip, the Vienna which is the city of dreams. Wrapped in the Viennese charm the city is blend with royal design and modern architecture. One would hardly believe if I say the guided tour to the Schonbrunn palace made me immersed in the imagination attending the royal dining with the queen and the princes, with the view to the amazing French style garden through the window of the palace. And definitely one can&#x2019;t miss out the prestigious Opera houses in the world. The Swarovski store in Vienna with amazingly decorated interior can never let go any women without a stop by. Nordsee, popular seafood and European fast food restaurant offers varieties of delicacies that I couldn&#x2019;t let go but made some random choices for the meal and yeah I liked it.Slowly, my heart felt a bit of pinch for the time had come to bade bye to the dream voyage. But we were glad, we shall be returning with some of the best treasure moments. We can never forget the smiles of every unknown passer-by, the help from the strangers when we lost track in spite of language barriers, the colour and fun filled lives in the city that never let you sleep and let you enjoy every bit as if it&#x2019;s the last day of your life can never be forgotten. And finally the hills and palaces and the feel of the renaissance era fresh from the history books shall truly be remembered. Time to say adieu with a wish to come back again. Auf Wiedersehen",

		"Text": "Yes! you heard it right. I personally consider Tso Moriri lake, leh Ladakh as a hidden treasure in the lap of Himalayas. Its one of the pristine lake I have ever seen. Such Emerald beauty. Tso Moriri is 220kms from main Leh town. And trust me the landscapes are literally the treat to an eye. Splendid it is. Such breathtaking views. But wait, let me tell you that the roads are not at all good. Its a pain in an ass, seriously. But as you know, the best thing in life comes after lot of struggle and pain. Just like everyone loves rose, but if you love rose you should be ready to grasp its thorn as well. so just brace up! It almost takes around 10 hours of ride, which blind cuts and curves. Majority of the road is broken, which actually leads to major accidents. so just beware! You need to be physically fit enough to have proper grip. Fitness should always be there. And i think I saw one of the most beautiful moon rise ever, rising proudly behind the majestic Himalayas. Its reflection in moon was so clear. And it was bit cloudy so even moon and clouds were playing hide and seek within themselves. Wonderful it was.Next morning as sun rays entered in my room making ways through dark shade curtains, i woke up. It was quite pleasant. Sunlight and chilled winds played well that morning. I walked down to the lake. I walked fill the end of lake. i got stuck in miry clay at times but i think its all worth it. Endless horizon. I was in complete awe! My Heart! I forgot everything, whatever I held within. I was just listening to the calming sound of Tso Moriri. Snow capped mountains were glowing as the sun rays directly fell on them. what a bliss it was, rolling down on the lush meadows. \nIndiaHotelsMapvillage near Tso moriri lake.Majestic Himalaya. That’s Mentok Kangri peak.Early morning vibes! what a joy it was to spend time on the bank of lake and reflecting about many things! self introspection time.chumathang valley,Leh Ladakh. what a beautiful sight it is! it looked like a desktop background, beauty!Tso kar lake, 67kms before Tso Moriri.Tso MoririTso moririTso MoririHotelsMapI crossed numerous of small and pretty villages, Like Chumathang, Sumdo etc, welcomed by the open arms and warm smiles on innocent faces. I felt like i was falling in love with the landscapes and innocence of people there. How beautiful it is to get lost in the lap of majestic Himalayas. Where numerous of pure and clear streams were flowing from numerous unknown sources, birds singing, sheep grazing the field, kids playing around, villagers welcomed with their warmest smile and joy on their faces by waving their hands, green patches on the ground covered with flowers which were blooming in full swing, white cotton candy clouds scattered in the clear blue sky, had end number of chai and Maggie, vibrant landscapes and much more. it was like a unending vast expanse of land covered with eternal beauty. And then i realized some places are untouched by human notions.Tso KarHotelsMapAnd there is one more hidden gem 67 km before Tso Moiriri lake named Tso Kar lake. Not a single human being was there! no one. So secluded and pure. And this is the actual hidden place or you can also say a perfect offbeat destination in India. water as clear as sky! all blue it was. I felt like there isn&apos;t any ending point, guarded by massive rugged snow clad Himalayas. Gaze the pristine blue water, few patches of clouds were reflected in that water, that reflection was so spectacular. It made me feel as if there were white small boats which looked much more similar to swans (from far) floating peacefully on that blue beauty.This place is so peaceful and worthwhile, away from all the city chaos and confusion. Though away from home I felt more like home, even miles away.",

But this year, Messi and Ronaldo would probably be playing their last world cup and I just can&apos;t miss that last spectacle of the greatest ambassadors of the game. Rooting for football in a cricket dominating country is always taken as a wannabe act but passion needs no approval. From the media and all its lost stories, I thought Russia would be a challenge, but something about the world converging over football in an unlikely place beckoned me.\t  \tWith a lot of skepticism and conjecture, I went ahead with my trip which almost took a year of planning along with my two friends (equally passionate for football and not just once in 4 years world cup fans).So, I would like to tell 8 things about Russia that people don&#x2019;t know:1) They do smile: like every citizen of every other country, they are loving and caring people, and they smile back with a lot of positivity. They are helpful, warm and ready to bridge the language barrier wherever possible.2) Bears are in the jungles, not in the streets: apart from dummy bear, and teddy bears in the shops, I didn&#x2019;t see bears hovering in the cities, ready to meet their meat.3) They are emotional: I almost saw the whole country from going crazy happy to crying over a football game.4) It&#x2019;s a safe country: the streets are always lit, they have amazing subway and public transportation system and one has to respect the country&#x2019;s law anyway (that applies anywhere in the world right!).5) Football hooliganism: just like every other passionate supporter, they love their game and they are ready to defend their passion for the game, and no they won&#x2019;t kill you if you support other countries.6) A lot of restrictions by the government: well you are allowed to drink inside the stadiums, how much more freedom you want.7) Best world cup ever: from the fans perspective, with the fan ids, this was one of the best and most hassle-free world cup ever.\t  \t8) Time is the key: 6:37 means 6:37, neither 6:40, nor 6:35.\t  \tWell, the list can go on but one just can&#x2019;t stop admiring how beautiful the country is, shout out to St. Petersburg city, surely the best, most picturesque and artistic city.",

The trek begins approx 5 Kms on the Leh-Manali highway from Gulaba checkpost. As we started our trek around 12 PM, we could not trek all the way up to Rola Khuli, so had to pitch the campsite about 4 kms before it.

It took us about 1 hour to reach Rola Khuli or Rola Kholi. It is a campsite nestled inside a small valley. The trek till Rola Khuli was moderate. It becomes more challenging after Rola Khulli because of the slope and snow covered mountains. It was a steep climb until Bhrigu Lake. Last 1 Km of the trek is though boulders.

We spent more than a hour around the lake and wanted to stick around for longer, but due to bad weather conditions had to head back to reach the campsite before nightfall.As it was snow all around, we were having trouble in trekking down. So, our guide advised us to slide ourselves down instead trek. And we ended up with most thrilling &amp; beautiful experience.

		"Text": "Tourists&apos; favourite hill state Himachal Pradesh has been facing the wrath of rain gods since past few days. The state has been reeling under flood leading to landslides and causalities.&#xA0;The Queen of Hills and state capital Shimla received the highest rain in 117 years, as per weather office.If you are planning a trip to Himachal, you might want to put off your plans. Here is everything you need to know about Himachal floods including blocked routes and weather forecasts.Deadly Floods(c)&#xA0;Hindustan TimesHimachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur informed that the floods have claimed at least 16 lives in the state as of August 13. The CM has ordered all senior officials of state government to review the situation that has raised due to heavy rainfall recently. CM&#xA0;Jai Ram Thakur has also directed an immediate restoration of roads, water and power supply. All the schools in the state have been shut owing to heavy rainfall.Landslides triggered by heavy rains claimed eight lives, including four deaths in Mandi, followed by four in Solan district, two each in Kangra and&#xA0;Hamirpur districts and one each in Una and Bilaspur.Blocked Routessource923 roads have been closed across Himachal Pradesh, including&#xA0;six National Highways, due to landslides. Landslides blocked Chandigarh-Shimla highway at various places.&#xA0;All trains on the Kalka-Shimla route were suspended on August 13.&#xA0;Road traffic was also disrupted for hours on Shimla-Nahan, Chamba-Pathankot, Mandi-Pathankot and Shimla-Kinnaur highways.&#xA0;The Chandigarh-Manali National Highway-21 has been closed for vehicles near Mandi.&#xA0;&#xA0;IMD Predicts Heavy Rainfall(c)&#xA0;Hindustan TimesThe rain fury doesn&apos;t seem to end anytime soon as&#xA0;India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy rainfall in the state for next 48 hours.Heavy to very heavy rains are likely to occur at isolated places in mid and low hills of the state during the next 24 hours. Light to moderate rains would occur at most places during the period. Further, heavy rains are likely to occur at isolated places in the state on August 16 and 17, IMD stated.Warning!(c) Indian ExpressState authorities have issued a warning for tourists and people living in low-lying areas to not to go near the Beas River as water is being released from the Pandoh Dam in Mandi district.Keeping in view the IMD predictions and poor vehicular movement in the state, it is best for tourists to avoid any plans for next one week at least.&#xA0;For more updates on places of your interest, stay tuned to Tripoto.

		"Text": "The great Walt Disney once rightly said that of all the means of mass communication, pictures still speak the most universally understood language. It is indeed commendable how pictures, despite being so minimalist as a medium, end up conveying even more than words do. However, it is rarely that we get a chance to honour all those people who put in their blood, sweat and tears to bring these frames to life. That is, until now!Starting 12 August 2018, right up to World Photography Day which falls on 19 August 2018, DLF Promenade will feature the work of Indian photographers with a unique photography exhibition. Open to all, Frame by Frame will celebrate the diversity in their work and promises to be something you should miss only at your own risk!Tell me more about it!In order to bring in World Photography Day (19 August 2018), DLF Promenade is hosting Frame by Frame, a week-long exhibition to showcase some of the most celebrated Indian photographers. Right from travel to food, fashion to architecture and even panoramas, the exhibition will span across a range of genres. Head to DLF Promenade this week to seek inspiration, get awestruck by the pictures on display and spend a day with your loved ones exploring stories behind each of these frames.Participating photographersThe World Photography Day exhibition will feature a bunch of stalwart photographers. Here&apos;s a quick rundown of all the masters whose work you can witness at the event:1. Ajay Jain\nA writer, traveller, entrepreneur and photographer, Ajay Jain has always been a man driven by passion. Jain refused to comply by the rules, quit his traditional 9-5 job just for his dream to travel the lengths of the world. The man behind the highly successful Kunzum Travel Cafe in New Delhi, Ajay now spends most of his time on the road, meeting new people and sharing their stories through his lens.2. Prasenjeet GautamWith more than a decade of experience, Prasenjeet Gautam is undoubtedly one of India&apos;s most versatile photographers. Whether it be wildlife or architecture or even fashion, Prasenjeet has pretty much explored all imaginable aspects of his craft. Expect to see a wide array of frames at his showcase this World Photography Day!3. Ravi DhingraIf you&apos;re someone who thinks its too late to follow your passion, Ravi Dhingra&apos;s story might just be the motivation you need. Dhingra worked in finance for as long as 13 years before realising that it is nothing but photography that gives him utmost satisfaction, and he has been a connoisseur of pictures ever since. Ravi hasn&apos;t looked backed since then and has over the years, emerged as one of India&apos;s most recognised lifestyle photographers.4. Vivek SinghA documentary filmmaker by profession, Vivek Singh is a man on a mission. Singh has been travelling through the remote parts of north-eastern India for about a decade now in search of stories that never meet the public eye. Vivek&apos;s display this World Photography Day promises a lot of hard hitting, raw and unfiltered frames that will leave you in complete awe.5. Amit PasrichaEver been to a place so beautiful that you felt like capturing all of it at once? Amit is a legend of sorts when it comes to panoramas which earns him his title of a panoramist (a man who paints panoramas). One look at his work and you&apos;ll realise why Pasricha is truly an artist who believes in constantly pushing his boundaries.When and where is the exhibition?The exhibition has been put up in DLF Promenade (Vasant Kunj, New Delhi) between 12 August 2018 to 19 August 2018. You can attend the photography showcase between 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. through the course of this duration.Who can attend?The exhibition is open to everyone during the above mentioned hours.If you want to meet and greet your favourite photographer and take some incredible tips from them, please be in the mall on 17th Aug. between 4:30 &#x2013; 6:00pmCreate your own photo blog and share your travel pictures with the Tripoto Community by simply clicking here.

		"Text": "Day 1My country India is well known for its heritage,culture,nature&apos;s view and its architecture.There are number of people who visit different places every day.. But i guess i am here to showcase something different.As we go to the different states in our country we get to see so many different types of cultures and also we get to witness the scenic beauty of the country.Similarly,there is one state that is famous for its extravagant natural beauty and that state is &quot;Himachal Pradesh&quot;.Manali is a beautiful town situated in the district of Kullu in the state of Himachal. Very well known for its scenic beauty,different adventure activities and a place of inner peace,Manali is home to hundreds of travellers from and outside India.Any time of the year you are visiting Manali,the weather is always pleasant and cold.But i would recommend is that the best time to visit Manali will be during the summers(just to beat the heat).I visited Manali just for couple of days,but there was some magic in that place which left me awestruck and when i came back Delhi,i was not the same person.There was something inside me,that changed.I cant say whether it was the peace or it was the beauty that came with me.But i can definitely say that i came back with some beautiful unforgettable memories that i am going to cherish forever.If you are a traveller(let it be solo,with friends or family) and you love adventure,then this place will serve you as the best treat ever.There are numerous adventure sports held here like Paragliding,River crossing,White water rafting,skiing(in winters) and also trekking.If you want to explore Manali deeply,you can rent a bike or hire a cab.From the Hot Water Springs to cool Beas River,everything can be felt in Manali.DAY 1 : DELHI TO MANALI 552 KMSBeing a person running an US process (Night shift in India),it was saturday morning when i started my journey .. i do not know the exact reason but i always prefer travelling by road over train journey.So i started by 552kms long journey.It generally takes 10-12 hours to reach Manali from delhi.So after taking few breaks and enjoying the glimpses of Natural Beauty,i finally reached my destination.FINALLY I AM BREATHING ..EnRoute Manali.. Glimpse of MOUNTAINSMajestic View entering KULLU.Day 2Gulaba ViewpointHotelsMapDAY 2: GULABA I reached Manali at around 8:30 pm and i was tired from my head to toe.Due to the lack of sleep i was feeling as if hammer is banging my head.I checked into my hotel and had my dinner and slept.Next morning my first destination was Gulaba.Gulaba is well known as an alternate destination if the Rohtang Pass is closed.Gulaba is near about 10 km far from manali bus stand but this is the best place to enjoy trekking. You can enjoy snow trekking here even in the month of may.So this is the best tourist place to visit in summers especially.Manali- Rohtang Highway via GULABAView of the Rohtang Pass from Gulaba POINT.&quot;Bhutta&quot;-Basic need when you are in a hill station.Horses Used to get up to the Snow Point Cant get over this view .. A Walk to Remember or A TRIP to Remember..??Day 4Cafe 1947HotelsMapCafe 1947,one of the best cafe in Manali. Named after the year India gained Independence,this restaurant serves Italian Grub. It is very well made cafe with a collection of books next to the counter. You can sit by the river and enjoy a good meal. The Cafe also holds live music sessions which are really popular. You should visit it once if you are in Manali.So hopefully i have given you guys a small tour to Manali with some beautiful pictures. Definitely have a visit once if you haven&#x2019;t been there Yet.P.S. :- ALL the PICTURES CLICKED BY ME .:)",

		"Text": "Konichiwa!I am a person who gets affected by her surroundings. So if you send me to a country with a beautiful visual aesthetic, I would be on cloud nine. Japan sets a great example - in terms of respecting nature and achieving amazing technological progress. Their collective mannerism is greatly refined - a very basic example being - they don&apos;t walk around in public eating or drinking. 9.9 on 10 japanese will never be spotted eating or drinking while walking the streets. The streets don&apos;t have dustbins installed everywhere and yet you won&apos;t find any garbage on the road. It&apos;s almost baffling. Without citing more examples (because I&apos;d rather you make the trip to believe it for yourself), I&apos;ll talk about my two week trip to this lovely country that has left a remarkable impression on me. I covered Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka and spent most of my time in Tokyo because that&apos;s where I wanted to be for the most part of my trip. It was hot and humid, but that kind of weather doesn&apos;t make me crazy at all (I hate cold weather, hot weather is most welcome. I&apos;m just designed like that). So I made the trip for July-August 2018. Hence, I serve my memories to you, fresh from the stove that was JAPAN in July. Enjoy!TOKYO\nDay 1TokyoHotelsMapWhere I stayed - Super Hotel Shinjuku. In the touristy heart of the city. Very close to most hangouts such as Kabukicho, Harajuku, Yoyogi and Akihabara. My room was on the twelfth floor with a great view. And if you have heard of the fancy washroom buttons throughout Japan, then I&apos;m happy to report my room had them too. The hotel has a great indoor onsen (hot spring) arrangement and a fantastic breakfast buffet. One of the most affordable hotels in Tokyo, for backpackers who don&apos;t want to hop hostels.I bought a tiny, gopro sized camera that shoots on HD for 2000 Indian Rupees. What fun. Pics below xD (wrong date mentioned in photo. Cheap camera who cares)Day 2Super Hotel Shinjuku KabukichoHotelsMapDuring my stay there, I had ramen, soba, sushi from the rotating belt, takoyaki (octopus balls), tuna salad, edamame and pretty much variations of these and nothing else. That was my food preference through and throughout. For drinks, I had water from the tap because it said you can and oolong green tea from the vending machines.Day 4TokyoHotelsMap  \tTokyoHotelsMapOfcourse I tried Sake (not a fan) but loved Highball (a very famous alcohol there). And I tried a gazillion sweets and chips from the department store becuse you only tokyo once (hope not).My absolute new find in food was the liquid jelly based vitamins, proteins, minerals off the shelf at Family Mart. Another brand &apos;Calorie Mate&apos; also offered similar stuff. That stuff was also my staple throughout the trip and I brought some packs back home with me.Day 6MitakaHotelsMapMitakaHotelsMap  \tDay 7Tokyo StationHotelsMapI bought a JR pass to commute around Japan and I must say it was very convenient. The nightlife in Tokyo is spectacular. Imagine bar hopping from a karaoke one to suddenly an LGBT one. Takeshita Street lives up to it&apos;s hype. Harajuku girls are a beautiful mess. Kawaii Monster Cafe is a must visit.Day 8Kawaii Monster CafeHotelsMapTokyo StationHotelsMapTOKYO DISNEYSEA also deserves a special mention simply for being all kinds of amazing. I have previously visited Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneysea, I promise you, is even better!Day 9Tokyo Disney SeaHotelsMap  \tTokyo Disney SeaHotelsMapIf you love Ghibli Studio&apos;s movies, Ghibli museum is a must for you. Just make sure you book online because they don&apos;t have offline tickets and you might just have to sigh sipping on your coffee across the road from it. (The cafe&apos;s window has birds that you can feed). Also, the studio&apos;s at Mitaka, which seems like a really posh area where people seem to be very rich and the roads are just BEAUTIFUL.If you are in Japan, it&apos;s almost expected of you to visit Shrines. I managed to squeeze a visit to the beautiful Meiji Shrine(Tokyo) and Fushimi Inari Shrine(Kyoto). Great experience.KYOTOYou reach Kyoto via Shinkasen, the bullet train in about 2.5 hours if my memory serves me right. MAN! You can&apos;t help jawdrop looking at how amazing that train is. The washrooms are in skyrise contrast to Indian trains, with all due respect to our railways here. Anyway, Kyoto is as clean as Tokyo, just not as &apos;happening&apos;. It&apos;s a calm , beautiful city. In case you crave for nightlife, reach Sanjo station and walk the lanes full of bars and riverside chilling. Besides the Fushimi Inari shrine visit and getting happy drunk in bars at Sanjo, I went to the popular Bamboo Grove and surrounding area at Arashiyama, slept by the river at Tugetsukyo Bridge, Besides these touristy things, I explored the silent restaurants across Kyoto.Day 12Fushimi Inari TaishaHotelsMap  \tBamboo groveHotelsMap  \tOSAKAIf I ever get the wonderful opportunity to live in Japan, I&apos;d choose Osaka over Tokyo. For starters, Osaka is a mere 50 minute away from Tokyo via metro, so you aren&apos;t missing anything. Secondly, it&apos;s as alive as Tokyo, only cheaper and with better tasting takoyaki. My highlights were the night markets and the Osaka harbor bay. Visited the most beautiful aquarium ever and bought stationery from Legoland. The good life, ladies and gentlemen.Day 13OsakaHotelsMap  \tTokyoHotelsMapAll in all, I would like to quote The Wombats, &quot;If you love me, let me go, back to that bar in Tokyo&quot;.

		"Text": "In this guide I&#x2019;d like to tell you about my 3-day trip to Triund Hill and Lahesh Cave and provide some information that I wish I knew when preparing for this trip. It could be especially useful for those who want to make this journey on their own, without an accompanying guide. [Disclaimer] Everything described here is my own experience. All the numbers regarding estimated walking times vary from person to person, weather and prices differ depending on the time of the year. For the reference, our trip was during the middle of June 2018, during the high season.Why going to Lahesh Cave?On the way to Lahesh CaveLahesh Cave is a cave located in a valley 5 hours away from Triund Hill. While Triund is a very popular trekking destination with lots of tents that are already set up, tons of cafes on the way and as a result, there is a large crowd climbing up there every day, Lahesh Cave remains pretty unknown, despite all the great views it has to offer. But because of it&#x2019;s relatively unknown status it&#x2019;s a perfect opportunity to spend a day in a secluded place, sleep in a cave overnight(!!!) and enjoy the untouched beauty of Himalayas. Furthermore, it&#x2019;s relatively easy to get there, you can do it without an accompanying guide.The RouteDay 1 Triund Hill\nTriund HillHotelsMapView at the Triund hill.The best place to start from is Mcleodganj. From there the first milestone is Gallu Devi Temple. It should take you at most two hours to get there. At Gallu Devi Temple you can take a tea-break and start your ascent to Triund Hill. It&#x2019;s very hard to get lost along the way because there&#x2019;s basically one trail and you should see cafes every 20 minutes along the way. However, the elevation is around 900 meters, so be ready to sweat. Going from the Guna Devi temple to Triund should take around 3-4 hours, not taking into account all the breaks to take pictures of the amazing views. There are many beautiful spots along the way, but the scenery at Triund Hill is even better.We started at around our journey 10am and with all breaks and lunches reached Triund at around 5pm. So I would definitely recommend starting in the morning if you don&#x2019;t want to trek in the dark.Day 2 Lahesh CaveLahesh CaveHotelsMapThe ceiling in Lahesh Cave is very low.After staying overnight in a tent at Triund Hill, we departed to the Lahesh cave early in the morning.The whole route should take you about 4 hours, but the weather in Himalayas is quite unpredictable. Even if the morning is sunny, it can rain for two hours in the afternoon. Keeping that in mind I would recommend starting early. I find the area around the Lahesh cave much more beautiful than the Triund Hill so it&#x2019;s better to spend more time there.The first part of this route goes till Snowline Cafe, it takes about 1.5-2 hours to get there. This is the last place where you can get food, so I would recommend making a stop there. I would also definitely ask the folks at Snowline Cafe to give you as detailed directions to Lahesh Cave as possible, because these will be your main source of navigation.For us, the part after Snowline Cafe was the most adventurous one. During the last hour of the hike there is no trail to follow. Instead, you follow a stream. At the beginning, you will be on the right side of it. The cave is on the other side so along the way try to find a good spot to cross the stream. While doing research for this guide I saw mentions of a trail leading directly to Lahesh Cave, we didn&#x2019;t find one so I would double-check this with the folks at Snowline Cafe.Day 3. Back to McleodganjMcLeod GanjHotelsMapThe way back is much easier, it took us around 6 hours of walking time to get back to Gallu Devi Temple following exactly the same path.EquipmentIf you don&#x2019;t have basic trekking clothes (like hiking shoes or a wind jacket) you can buy those in McLeodGanj. I trekked in my running shoes, but I don&#x2019;t advice that because there&#x2019;s a greater risk of getting an injury. You will also need a tent to sleep and there are two different options to get one.Option 1. Renting gear in McleodganjYou can rent a tent, sleeping bag and a mattress in one of the numerous trekking organizers in Mcleodganj. Even if you don&#x2019;t want to book a tour they will happily rent you equipment. After visiting literally every tour organizer in the town, we can claim that the best price you can get without outstanding bargaining skills is 1000Rp for a tent+2 sleeping bags+2 mattresses of mediocre quality. The price is per night.Option 2. Renting a tent in TriundAnother option would be to rent a tent directly at Triund, there are many tents that are already set up and waiting for the guests. A clear advantage is that you don&#x2019;t have to carry the tent all the way up and the price is the same as renting a tent in McLeodGanj. But on the other hand you still need a sleeping bag and a matrace for Lahesh Cave. Theoretically, you can rent those at Triund Hill as well, but it&#x2019;s a subject to availability, so there&#x2019;s a small risk that there will be none.We went for the first option, I don&#x2019;t mind trekking with a tent in my backpack and it&#x2019;s nicer when you don&#x2019;t have to worry about the logistics during the trip.FoodFor me, food is an important part of trekking experience. A cup of chai with rice and dal after a day of trekking refuels your energy and tastes better than in any fancy restaurant. Therefore here&#x2019;s an extensive guide about eating options during the McLeodGanj - Lahesh Cave trek.Eating at TriundDuring the first day you can get every meal in one of the numerous cafes located along all the way to Triund Hill as well as on the hill itself. On the way you can get instant noodles as well as many snacks. On the hill there&#x2019;re more options like rice with dal or omelette with toast. On the second day the last place to get the food cooked for you is Snowline Cafe.Eating at Lahesh CaveYou will have to get at least two meals at Lahesh Cave (a dinner on the 2nd day and a breakfast on the third day). The best thing to do for dinner thing is to make a bonfire. For that you will have to prepare in advance. There&#x2019;s no wood available around the cave, the last place you can collect some is at Snowline Cafe. Also, quite probably wood will be wet, so you need kerosine to light it up. You can buy some in McLeodGanj, we found a very helpful guy at a Indian supermarket on the Dharamkot Rd., who arranged 500ml of kerosine for 50Rp for us.There&#x2019;re many bonfire dishes. If you manage to get a pot, you can cook basically anything. However, to boil the water you will need a lot of wood. We just grilled mushrooms on the open fire on a stick. With a bit of salt they tasted amazingly good! After that we made tons of s&#x2019;mores. Breakfast however was less successful. We were supposed to bake potatoes in the ashes (we left them for too long and potatoes themselves turned into ashes) and eggs that we asked to boil for us in one of the cafes (they were boiled hard enough and completely crashed in the back pack).On the way back you have all the same options you had on the day one: numerous cafes on the hill and on the way down.WeatherThe weather will obviously depend entirely on the season. There are two things however that I keep getting wrong. Firstly, at the 3000m altitudes it gets cold even if it&#x2019;s summer downhills. The temperature at Lahesh Cave can fall to 1-2&#xB0;C in June, so make sure to take warm clothes and good sleeping bags. Also, it rains a lot in Himalayas and quite often you want to keep going. Buying a very cheap plastic raincoat in McLeodGanj can save you from a light rain.Stretch goalsIf you have one more day or you feel super energized and willing to trekk more, there are several options availableIndrahar Pass (4300m)View at Indrahar PassLocated at the 4300m altitude, Indrahar Pass can be reached from Lahesh Cave within 3 hours. But keep in mind, the way is super steep and will require you to be in good shape, especially considering that this is the 3rd hiking day.Moon Peak (4632m)Even a more ambitious goal is to continue to Moon Peak after reaching Indrahar Pass. The internet suggests that you can do both in one day. However, if travelling on your own, without a guide I&#x2019;d be more conservative and devote a whole extra day to it.Now it&#x2019;s time to packThese are the most important things I wanted to tell. I hope that it will help you to have a safe and fun journey!You can help to make this guide more useful by sending information that is missing or not up-to-date.Special thanks to Balie Tomar for proofreading a draft of this article.",

		"Text": "safar mein yeh banjara!!It&apos;s Goa Baby, the ultimate party destination of India is definitely much much more than just sunny beaches,cheap booze,casinos and shacks.The place is in it&apos;s full glory during the monsoons and missing that will be definitely a bag packer&apos;s blunder.I happened to have that experience on my first solo trip.Generally you happen to explore the India&apos;s smallest state with either your friends or family but trying it out solo will definitely give new dimensions of your craving for the rich past of this Portuguese settlement.Exploring it in the off season will save your tremendous bills and give you the space and calm one expects from Goa.I landed at the Dabolim airport around 10:30 pm and had to take a private taxi for my hostel in Panjim -&apos;Old crowd by hostelworld&apos; as no ola/uber work there and the public transport sucks!! but sharing a ride with locals made me realize why life in the rest of India is a bullshit and what brings in the spirit of Goa,moreover the Locals are always welcoming and charming and never try to misguide/rob you.The first day started with the traditional Goan breakfast which was fulfilling and I stepped out with an umbrella and powerbank hitchhiking from one tourist place to another and taking public transport as per the availability. I was able to cover up almost the entire Old Goa , the remains of the city are a UNESCO world heritage sight and a must visit for anyone interested in museums, history and architecture.All the sights are located in close proximity to each other and can be covered easily in 3 hours max.My next stop was fort Aguada which is a well preserved 17th century Portuguese fort in Sinquerim beach with overlooking green palms on one side ,together with a lighthouse that allows you to feel the salty air marinated with monsoon drizzle.You feel the calm, embrace your life and cherish everything that has come your way in lifetime.One of the best thing while staying in a hostel is , you never feel you are traveling solo as you meet so many wonderful people/groups from across the globe who share the same madness as yours and you become a part of it. The best part of the trip was to happen next when i returned to my hostel and met an incredible Austrian guy by the way who was a high school teacher who was also traveling solo and slept in the same dorm, we quickly became good friends and went on to explore the Portuguese village of Fontainhas in Panjim in the vicinity of my hostel , loitering aimlessly on those beautiful streets made me realize there is something magical about Goa which connects strangers miles apart, it connects people who seek pleasure in wanderlust , doing things without much thought,enjoying the moment and living in the present. We accidentally bumped into two beautiful art galleries - Gitanjali and of &apos;Antonio Xavier Trindade&apos; whose work we felt was unrecognized to the rest of the world,and even those ancient Portuguese styled temples ,churches,houses and the creeks made the night one of the best experiences ever.The Day 2 went in exploring the life of Panjim,churches and those artistic streets.I visited the historic &apos;Blue Building&apos; which now houses the Indian customs and central Excise museum, the only of it&apos;s kind in India along the Mandovi river.The next stop was Dona Paula which was a cliff beach and also the point of confluence of Zuari and Mandovi rivers into the Arabian sea.The views you get from top are breathtaking and don&apos;t feel like leaving the magical place.And how could a Goa itinerary be fulfilled without a beach visit, so i visited the Miramar beach which i found a bit filthy but the Baga and Candolim were amazing to spend some quality time.Though my trip was ending very soon , but Goa had some preplanned surprises for me, as my train to Mangalore was from Madgaon , the bus journey from Panaji to Madgaon will be forever cherished within me.No sooner did my bus start that i felt the bus is traversing through heaven , i made it a point not to click any pictures and rather be a part of the moment,enjoy the present and enjoy those scenic paddy fields and mountains.\nThe best part about Goa is it&apos;s an unlimited package of natural beauty and cultural experience , unlike most of the tourist attractions Goa&apos;s magic is not confined to it&apos;s few famous spots rather there are uncountable unexplored experiences and adventures to account for in such a small area of sea and land.People generally fight which is better north/south Goa but i feel every part of the entire Goan state has it&apos;s own charm and you can&apos;t be judgemental in that.Sometimes you feel you are driving through water bodies the very next moment you find paddy fields , mountains ,waterfalls and forests.SO doing it SOLO IS DEFINITELY A MUST EXPERIENCE FOR A LIFETIME.PS:Thank you &apos;Old crowd by Hostelworld&apos; for such a memorable stay and keep doing the awesome work.Sorry for poor camera quality",

		"Text": "Loved this quiet feline in Chopta, Uttarakhand (April, 2018)Hey folks! If you&apos;ve stumbled here, then you&apos;re in luck! I will be sharing the mantra which will help you win the Tripoto Leaderboard or other giveaways Tripoto has to offer. But first a little about how I got started.Last year, an awakening occurred for me. I thought to myself, why not to document my travels somewhere? And while I tried writing on various famous social platforms, it just didn&apos;t work out for me. Something was missing. I had almost given up when I noticed Tripoto. A common platform to write &amp; also gain inspiration from the experiences of others, this seemed the ideal fit. There was a sense of personal touch in the stories I read from other travelers. So, I began.Writing for myself, I penned down all the nitty-gritty details with true emotions. I wasn&apos;t even aware at the time that Tripoto ran various contests. After writing for a few days, I noticed my photo and name in a Leaderboard (bless that moment!). Till that moment I didn&apos;t even know a Leaderboard existed! Here I was, #7 already! So, I wrote and wrote, till I became a runner up &amp; won myself a fully sponsored winter trek! How cool is that?Not only that, this year Tripoto invited me for lunch &amp; recognized me as one of their first ambassadors among 12 others. There are additional perks to that, but that&apos;s a story for another day.    \nLet&apos;s break down as to how I managed to achieve this feat:1) Page for Contests.To know the what&apos;s at stake, browse to their dedicated page to check out Tripoto&apos;s latest offerings:https://www.tripoto.com/travel-for-free-contestCredit Earning OpportunitiesBased on the content/mood you have you can either start writing&#xA0;(assuming you&apos;ve already signed up) a travelogue or if you&apos;re not much into writing, then you can opt for photo/video blog.&#xA0;if the content is fascinating you&apos;ll be awarded anything between 0-100 credits.&#xA0;Hence, be creative. Tripoto&apos;s editorial team always prefers quality over quantity. Another way to earn credits would be to post QA on tripoto travel forum.&#xA0;A lot of travelers post queries here. Be their helping hand with your relevant answers. Pro Tip: A lot of strangers become friends here and plan for their own trip ;) Hence, it&apos;s always best to share with like-minded travelers. If you have a query of your own, well, post it! If not others, Tripoto&apos;s own experts might answer your queries!Another way of earning credits would be to&#xA0;Refer a friend.&#xA0;Now that you have the awesome Tripoto app, share it with your friends. Every user has their unique &quot;referral code&quot;. Once your friends sign up, you&apos;ll receive 5 credits, they will get 10. If they write a blog, you get 20!Here is my referral code y&apos;all: shashanksinha&#xA0;(https://www.tripoto.com/users/register?invite_key=shashanksinha) .Install the cool app and begin reading, writing or planning your trips!By now you must be wondering, all these credits for what!? Read on my friend.OnGoing Giveaways.All those hard earned credits can be redeemed in exchange of coupons/sponsored travel Tripoto has to offer. It can be a trek, a biking trip, a cycling trip or a getaway to an exotic location in a lavish resort etc etc! Isn&apos;t that amazing? Since you wrote and gave back to the community, Tripoto rewards you back. :)2) Contest runs between 1st and last date of the monthNow that you know what&apos;s the catch, let&apos;s get down to business. Start writing your travelogues as early as possible. Be quick, but don&apos;t compromise on quality. That would be your fundamental rule to follow.Credits will be awarded after your travelogue is submitted/published. It can take 24-48 hours to reflect it in your account. That&apos;s because Tripoto is assessing the quality of your write up. Since you&apos;d be writing from the very first week, you would be able to keep up with the other competitors in the leader-board. And yes, keep refreshing the leader-board to know where you stand ;)ProTip:&#xA0;Start publishing from the 1st week of the month to have a better chance to maintain that headstart.3) Write Comprehensively (Do Not Plagiarize)Once again, quality is priority here and it must not be bargained upon. Write as if you were reliving your travel moment. Highlight the bend you took which made your travel short! The price of the bus ticket from Manali to Keylong, Snaps of the local cuisine you had in Andaman &amp; how much you paid for it, the hotel you stayed at along with a basic review if possible. All this helps the other readers to plan their trips/travels and for you to gain more followers :DProTip:&#xA0;Catchy title of your travelogue, to gauge interest of the reader.Do not plagiarize the content from other channels. This wrongful conduct can lead to disbarring your write-up/profile or zero credits given. You can take it up with their support team however they&apos;ll tell you the same. I have noticed people throwing tantrums regarding &quot;No Credits Given&quot; issue on Tripoto&apos;s QA forum, however looking closely at their content I&apos;ve found them to be wrong. Have confidence in your originality.4) Add location/linksHands down Tripoto&apos;s writing space is super easy. Even a kindergarten kid will not get lost here. Okay, that&apos;s a bit too much. My point being, the page is barely complex. It&apos;d be as if you are writing in MS-Word &amp; not on a complicated blog page! It&apos;s that simple.ProTip:&#xA0;Use all the functionalities this space has to offer. You&apos;d notice there are various little plugins to add location, insta link, regular hyperlinks or to format texts (Bold, Italics etc). Use them to your advantage. It&apos;ll give an&#xA0;aesthetic look to your travelogue &amp; well, brownie points (credits!) to you.Here is snapshot of the plugins:5) Insert lots of Images/Videos (If not yours, give due credits)Wouldn&apos;t it be a bit boring to simply read along without looking at something to? Exactly. Pull out the hard disk from that desk &amp; plug it in. What&apos;s the point of storing splendid photos/videos you shot on your travels, in a hard-disk or on Google drive if you can&apos;t even flaunt it, right? The other travelers will get so much help looking at your pictures.ProTip: Put more shots of the location, the flora/fauna, the landscapes &amp; a bit less of your own. I think you know why ;)6) Track LeaderboardWithout this golden rule, I would have never won the competition myself. From my own account I can shed light on this matter. Every third day I&apos;d write a great piece and find myself leading the pack, only to find by evening or the next dawn, my lead had slipped! It encouraged me to write extensively &amp; follow other competitors &amp; what they were up-to. Do not worry if the other writers went to Europe and you didn&apos;t! A comprehensive blog about Ladakh (Say with itinerary) can yield more credits than somewhat average write-up about a road trip in Spain or a getaway in Norway! Important thing is to take inspiration from other travelogues and convey your own story in a unique way! Quality over Quantity alway, never forget!It looks something like this:(Best of luck to the above competitors this month. Keep on sharing your awesome trips with us!)ProTip:&#xA0;I recently learnt, it&apos;s not a compulsion to only write about a place you yourself have been to. For example: If you haven&apos;t been to Japan but know about local cuisines or Takayama festival (held in April) you can write it too! It&apos;s all about spreading awareness on Tripoto.So there you are, all caught up with the mantra &amp; the key to unlock your own success story!

You can plan this trip in case you are staying in Krabi or Phuket.Here is a small video of my trip :\t  \tI would suggest not to purchase this tour from hotel or airport as its very expensive.You can save money by booking the trip online by signing up here:https://www.klook.com/invite/Q161ZThe package includes:-Hotel Pickup from main locations-Boat Transfer-Life jacket-Lunch (veg and non-veg options with unlimited cola/water)-fruits as the snack at end of the tourThere is two kind of options:-Speed Boat transfer -Big Boat transferThe first option can be bumpy sometimes because of rough see but it takes less time. It took around 1 hour from the pier to the James Bond island by the Big Boat.We had the first stop for the Kayaking at Phang Nga Bay, where water is not so clean but kind of muddy. The most exciting part is Kayaking through the caves. In case of high tides, you may not be able to Kayak as high water level made it difficult to enter into the narrow openings of the caves.You can enjoy it for 30-45mins to take photos or videos but it&apos;s usually overcrowded so not enough to find your personal space :)After a quick stop at Phang Nga Bay, we had the lunch in the boat itself. Lunch was good enough as it has Fried chicken, chicken curry, veg curry, chicken fried rice, veg fried rice etc.Later on, we were taken to the James bond island, but it was done by transferring into a small boat. Be careful of all your belongings and kids while transferring from one boat to other as tides may create a lot of movement in the boats.There are toilets on the James bond island for men and women. You can spend 30-45 minutes on the island to takes photo or buy some souvenir.Before the end of the trip, we were taken to the other island where we could do kayaking and Swimming for 15-30 minutes. This part of the tour was very refreshing as a quick swim in the cold water after a hot day helped us recharge our batteries. We were taken back to the main boat and offered fresh fruits to hydrate yourself.We were taken back to the pier after 1-hour ride before we were dropped back to the hotel around 7PM.I would suggest booking the same tour to enjoy the best of Phuket has to offer.https://www.klook.com/activity/3227-james-bond-island-phang-nga-bay-big-boat-tour-phuket/Hope you have a good time in Phuket, please leave your suggestion or doubts on the link or in the video comments :)",

After having our breakfast in one of the local shop near the airport itaelf, we hired ola to our friend&apos;s house. After some rest we started towards our destination, pondocherry. As we already had a booking in the ksrtc&apos;s AC sleeper bus, we took our bus from St. John&apos;s Bus stand.&#xA0; Experience of travelling in the ksrtc bus was awesome. Once you booked your tickets, ksrtc will keep updated you about the bus time table, bus number, and the exact arrival time of bus at your pick up point which is really the best part of their service. We took our bus at 9:53 and the AC sleeper of this bus was much better than any of the train&apos;s sleeper coach. Very much comfortable and we took a proper sleep in the bus till we reach pondicherry..Day 2Early morning at around 6 am we reached pondicherry. As soon as we reached there, I was so curious to see a beach for the first time. We took a local bus from bus stand to auroville (our first destination). After some rest in hotel, we hired 3 bikes @1200 rupees&#xA0; to roam around in the city for the whole day. We had our breakfast at one of the local dhaba there. Sambhar, vada, idli, dosa this is all one can find as the main menu in breakfast in south. The food was so tasty and that is in a minimal price. We had around 10-12 dosas, n number of idli and vadas and the total bill cost around us just 400 rupees! After breakfast, we went to the white town in pondicherry.&#xA0;&quot;White Town&quot; is the French Quarters in Pondicherry primarily the French families still living there and the houses being converted into heritage hotels and&#xA0;restaurants and art galleries. A very well planned clean laid out area with trees providing a continuous shade and buildings dominated with pale yellow color. After spending some time at beach, we went to La cafe cafe besides one of the beach Finally we rides our bikes to our last destination in pondicherry, &quot;Auroville&quot;. Auroville is famous for the matrimandir (focal point of auroville town).",

Its a short ride of around 70 KM, but with good scenery along with the hair pin bends.First thing first, we stopped at the &quot;Indian Parantha Company&quot; for the delicious brunch.I would suggest to try the &quot;Makki Ki roti&quot; &amp; &quot;Sarson ka saag&quot;, its one of the best i had in Bangalore.You should give it a try to &quot;Paranthazaa&quot; also, where i parantha is used as pizza base with &quot;achari paneer&quot; and cheese as the toppings.The ride to thee Hills are usually quite smooth, but due to the ongoing maintenance work along the roadside its become little risky. Be careful about the stones or other construction material lying on the road.There was a little traffic jam on the top of the hill, as one of the brand new Toyota Innova was getting towed away. It had the temporary registration number plate on, so i am assuming its few days old baby trying to run up to the hill causing some engine malfunction. I would not suggest any newbie driver to drive up the hill, as some of the hair pins bends are very tight to maneuvers the cars.There is enough parking space at the hill, it cost 40 Rs for the parking which also includes the entry fee. The view from the hill is beautiful, with lot of families enjoying the picnic around the different parts of the garden. There is facility for buying the Snacks, Tea, paid Toilet etc on the hills.If you are looking for a few hours drive away from the Bangalore traffic, this is the best spot.Hope you get to enjoy the beauty of Nandi Hills soon :)",

		"Text": "Beautiful Mountains :)Who wouldn&apos;t like to stay away from hustle and bustle of city life for a couple of weeks and enjoy the pristine beauty of India&apos;s less explored travel destination? After wanting to visit Ladakh for many years, I finally made it this summer :) (summer of 2018). I have now been working at the same place for four years and had taken less than five long vacations. I had a lot of leaves and was in need of a much needed break. To add on, my parents were looking to get me married and I sensed this could be my last free summer to do things that I have been wanting to do from a long time. A month of planning by watching vlogs of fellow travelers on YouTube and travel posts on Tripoto helped me finalize the places to visit and the route. A few finer details were given my friend from college who completed this trip a year ago. The most difficult part was to convince my parents about this solo trip. After convincing them about the safety and showing them a few articles about Ladakh, they finally agreed to this trip :) \nDay 1BangaloreHotelsMapI started off in Bangalore on 15th June. The first major task was to get my bike on train to Delhi. I reached the parcel office of Bangalore railway station by 9am and quickly got my bike packed and it was ready for parcel. As I was ready to board my train at 8pm, there was a heavy downpour. My brother and parents had come to the station to help me with the luggage and saw me off. My dream vacation finally began. It was my first journey on India&apos;s elite train - The Rajdhani Express. One encounters people from different walks of life on trains and I always have had memorable experiences on train journeys. My companion on this journey was a one and half year old kid and the journey didn&apos;t seem like 33 hours. Day 3DelhiHotelsMapI reached Delhi on Sunday and I checked into a budget backpack hostel. I quickly freshened up and went to the railway station to receive my bike which was coming on Karnataka Express. I collected my bike after a small amount of paper work and against as planned to rest in Delhi, I started off my journey at around 1pm from Delhi. ChandigarhHotelsMapI wanted to cover as much distance as possible and I set Bilaspur as my target for stopping at for overnight rest. A few stops on the way for the famous Punjabi lassi later I realized that it would be wise to stop at Chandigarh and rest. The journey from Delhi to Chandigarh was smooth and the highway had huge paddy fields on both sides for almost throughout the journey. At about 40kms before I reached Chandigarh, I was happy to see a KA registration bike overtake and stop to talk to me. I had my first travel friend and we decided to explore Chandigarh together. A quick check-in at a home-stay booked via Booking.com and we were off to visit the Rock Garden and Sukhna lake. The planning of the city impressed me a lot - well planned roads, localities and civic amenities. I really enjoyed walking around the Sukhna lake and it was an evening well spent. Once sun set, we headed back to our room. We ordered food at the home-stay and the cook prepared a delicious meal - or was it good because I didn&apos;t have a proper meal since breakfast? It was actually good :) After a good night&apos;s sleep on a bed finally (first time outside the train), we set out on our journey to Manali. Rahul was to accompany me until Manali and he would catch up with his group at Manali. I however wanted to reach Keylong, a small yet beautiful place in Himachal Pradesh. We set out by 5 30am and twisting roads through the many mountains led us to Manali. The journey had its share of breaks for food, pictures and fuel. After having lunch in Manali, I continued to Keylong. Rain gods accompanied me for about two hours. An hour and a half from Manali was the first checkpoint where permits had to be shown. I was unaware that a permit had to be collected in Manali as there were no instructions/sign boards mentioning this. When the police first told me to go back and get the permit, I literally had tears in my eyes. It was already about 4pm and returning to collect the permit and crossing Rohtang pass was an impossible task. Also, Rohtang pass is closed on Tuesdays for maintenance. Had I not cleared Rohtang pass then, it would have unsettled my entire itinerary. A sorry face and me pleading the official for about 20 minutes, they finally let me towards Rohtang pass. Day 4Koksar Bus StopHotelsMapSharp turns, steep ascent and freezing weather - the journey had all elements for an exciting ride. I finally made it to the top at about 5 30pm. A lady was selling tea at the peak and I celebrated my first accomplishment with two cups of hot tea. I met a group of 4 people from Tamil Nadu at the summit and we started the descent together. Heavy rains made the descent a lot more difficult and by the time sun set, I could only make to Koksar (40kms behind my target of stopping at Keylong). It was already about 14 hours of drive for the day and I decided to stay in a tent with the people from Tamil Nadu. It was freezing cold but being tired, I fell asleep quickly after a small meal. After a good night&apos;s rest, we wanted to start off early and reach Leh but we started off late. We stopped for breakfast at Jispa at 9am. The road ahead had a few river crossings and the group from Tamil Nadu were slow. I decided to break away from the group and started riding solo. I made it to Sarchu by around lunch time. The scenery around me was very beautiful but the roads were in a very poor shape (this isn&apos;t a complaint on any government/organization - just sharing the experience). The concentration and focus needed on these roads is very high and the journey was painstakingly slow. This passage is a true test of one&apos;s physical and mental strength. I wanted to give up this journey and turn back. While I was taking a break, I met two students from Hyderabad in their final year of engineering. Two of them on a single bike on a shoe string budget who made it with sheer passion and love to travel! I tagged along with them and made it to Pang where I halted overnight. It was freezing cold and oxygen levels were low at this altitude. After spending about two hours at this campsite, many of us at the place started developing headaches and breathlessness. The host however was a very sweet man and took good care of us. We were served delicious aloo paratha and tea. A relatively longer rest at night brought up my energy levels and I was in a good frame of mind today. We set off to finally reach Leh. The road from Pang was excellent and I zoomed past mountains :) On the way I got the chance to experience driving in snowfall. I was overjoyed. En-route to Leh we crossed TangLang-La. A few snaps and timelapse experiments later, we headed out to Leh. In one of our break, we realized that we had to make to Leh by 3 30pm to get the inner line permit to go to Nubra valley and Pangong lake. We decided to speed up and reached Leh by 3pm just to find out that it was a holiday in Leh - yet another minor upset in plans. We then looked for a room and rested for a while. Day 6LehHotelsMapOnce sun set, we headed off to explore the Leh market. It was a wonderful evening spent amidst lovely people and hospitality. I absolutely loved the evening spent in Leh. The next morning, we were up quickly and took the inner line permit needed to visit Nubra valley and Pangong lake. En-route to Nubra valley is Khardung La (the world&apos;s highest motorable road open for public). As we reached Khardungla, there was a sense of achievement. There were a group of few Germans talking to the Indian army and appreciating their efforts and services - goosebumps!! Next, we headed off to Diskit - a small village in Ladakh region. Awaiting at this place was a giant beautiful statue of Mythreyi Budha statute. There was a sense of calmness at this place as we sat down admiring the giant statue. The view from this place was just amazing - snow capped peaks at a distance and a desert nearby. Before sunset, we also wanted to enjoy the double hump camel ride. We started off to reach the ride place but we took a wrong route which we realized after travelling about 25kms. We accidentally ended up in a village called Sumur. I think this stay was the best so far in this trip - a beautiful homestay and delicious food for a very reasonable price. As we had missed the camel ride, we decided to go for it again the next day. The camel ride was at a place called Hunder, about 10kms from Diskit. We ended up passing by the Budha statue again. The camel ride was a good experience. We found a lot of young children playing at this place. The famous Pangong Lake was the next stop for us. Visiting this place had been my dream for many years and it was just a few hours away from coming true. Day 8Pangong LakeHotelsMapTo add twist to the tale - this incident happened. As I was riding from Hunder, I heard the sound of a bolt falling off. I quickly stopped and looked around to see a 2 inch bolt lying on the ground. However, not knowing from where it fell off, I put the bolt in my pocket and headed off to Pangong Lake. The route from Hunder to Pangong Lake is the lesser chosen route by travelers. After covering about 30 kms, my front wheel stopped moving. The area looked very deserted and we could hardly find anybody around us. Upon inspection, I realized the bolt holding the disc brake to the wheel was missing. I somehow managed to fix it with the help of my friends travelling along and headed off to Pangong Lake. We reached the place by around 5pm and again, it was freezing cold here. From at about 20kms before we reached the lake, there was heavy army presence. It scared me a little not that something would happen to me or my life - but just that the sight of guns all around isn&apos;t as pleasing. We found a room right in front of the lake and we spent the evening at the lake. My dream finally came true :) Day 9LehHotelsMapThe next morning, we enjoyed spending time at the lake with sun shining upon the lake and the lake began showing its true beauty by changing colors as a result of reflection of light on water. It was a beautiful sight - a memorable moment for lifetime. As we started back to Leh, I realized that I was low on fuel and the next place where fuel would be available was about 150kms away. I bought fuel in black paying Rs110 per litre. On the way was an army camp distributing &apos;Prasad&apos; and a handful of dry fruits to all. After a brief stop at this place, we continued our journey to Leh and stopped at Thiksey monastery. The monastery was unique in architecture and was very beautiful. From this height, the view of Leh city was amazing.&#xA0;After covering about 1700kms, our bikes needed some attention and care. We got the bikes repaired at a small place in Leh city. We reached Leh by night and this was also when Fifa was being played. We caught up on the Fifa action for a while having dinner and were off to bed quickly.This was the end to our stay in Leh and Ladakh region basically. The trip was on my wish list for years and a month of planning later, the time in Ladakh ended very quickly. Our destination for the day was Kargil. The ride to this destination however had many breaks and we took it easy as the roads were in excellent condition and we had to cover only about 200kms. Day 10KargilHotelsMapPauses at Hall of Fame, the famous sangam at Zanskar valley and magnetic hall for our breaks and a long stop for lunch at Saspol later we realized that we had to cover about 150kms and it was already 3pm. As we started off to Kargil, there was heavy breeze and riding to this place was extremely difficult. Our progress was slow but we finally made it to Kargil. The place looked very scary. The muslim population was very high. We got a room cheaply again on the edge of a river. A walk to the city center for dinner scared the hell out of us and we ran back to our room.We got up quickly and headed off to Srinagar the next morning. Dras war memorial was our first stop for the day. A short movie was played at this memorial about the Kargil war and we all got goosebumps watching it. The memorial is a good tribute for the brave Indian army.&#xA0;The last pass on our trip was the Zozila pass on the way to Srinagar. The roads to the pass were in very bad shape and overnight showers at this place made the ride challenging. Once we crossed Zozila pass, it was plain roads and we pushed our bikes to the limit. We reached Srinagar by 4pm but army presence around the city scared us. A wise decision take by us however was to change plan of stopping at Srinagar. As the highway to Jammu was brilliant, we zoomed past mountains, small villages and towns. Day 11RambanHotelsMapAfter a suggestion from army personnel and a shopkeeper, we decided to stop at Ramban. Ramban however seemed quite far away and it took 3 hours to reach from the time we enquired with the shopkeeper. We checked in by 9pm and were completely exhausted after the long ride. By reaching Ramban, we made things easy for ourselves by reducing the distance to be covered for the next day. Good roads meant we could cover distance quickly and we reached Amritsar rather easily. There was a drastic change in weather conditions though as we entered Punjab. It was about 5-10 degrees in the evenings at Pangong/Pang and it was about 45 degrees in Punjab!&#xA0;Day 12AmritsarHotelsMapWe made a booking via OYO rooms and it was 2km from the Golden temple. After checking in and freshening up, we were out again to see the Golden temple. The temple was brilliant under lights and we sat down for a while admiring the beauty of the temple and observing people who had been visiting the temple. Being tired on riding our bikes from the past ten days, we decided to take an auto to the temple. The ride back was again in auto and it had just begun to rain. This will probably be the most unforgettable ride in life. The auto driver was zooming in 10 feet roads and there was many instances when just two wheels were in contact with road!&#xA0;We got up a little late the next day and went to Golden temple again to see the temple in daylight and have a darshan. It was a peaceful morning and I&apos;ll cherish the time spent. We next went to see the famous Jalianwala Bagh - a historic site. I was finally at the place I had read about all my childhood and we could see the bullet marks on the walls.&#xA0;At about 30kms from our room was the Attari border (Wagah border). The evening retreat is regarded as one of the few priceless cultural moments in India. We had reached there by 3pm for a 5 30pm ceremony only to find scores of people already waiting. Though the conditions were overcast and rain threat looming large, we sweat profusely in the humidity. The weather conditions however couldn&apos;t dampen our excitement. The venue was like a stadium and we were few meters away from actual Pakistan border. There was happiness, excitement, energy in each of the visitor at this place.&#xA0;There was one person narrating the event to us and was ensuring the crowd was engaged and ensured that we spectators cheered the policemen performing the retreat. There were chants of &quot;Bharat Mata ki Jai&quot; and when close to six thousand people chant it together, the atmosphere is filled with energy and patriotism. The evening spent at the border will never be forgotten.&#xA0;It was time for the last leg of our journey and we headed off to Delhi at about 5 30am to beat the heat. After an hour&apos;s ride, we encountered heavy rains - it was time to pull out our raincoats. I think the rain gods heard our complaint that Punjab was too hot and humid and decided to give us a wet send off. The rain was relentless and continued to pour for the next four hours.&#xA0;&#xA0;Day 14DelhiHotelsMapWe finally made it to Delhi by around 5pm completing the 500km journey from Amritsar. We had a quick shower and were off to bed in no time.&#xA0;The main task for today was to get back our bikes on train and I had heard already from my friends that it isn&apos;t an easy task in Delhi. We had reached the Delhi station and the packing of our bikes began. Once we took the vehicle inside, we found that my bike wouldn&apos;t be taken here as my train ticket was from a different station (Hazrat Nizzamuddin). I was shocked to hear that. The confusion occurred because in Bangalore I was told bikes will not be loaded in Rajdhani Express as it is reserved for perishable items. So, I thought a step ahead and went to Delhi station (the starting point for Karnataka Express).&#xA0;I unpacked the bike and was racing against time to reach Hazrat Nizammuddin station packed my bike. I got back to our room and took all luggage to board the train. After spending a week with these two people, we had to head back to our homes but we already a good bond and vowed to stay in touch.&#xA0;I reached the station early and wanted to see my bike being loaded but walking with my huge luggage was very difficult. I still managed to walk around and after bribing different people (railway official, bike loading person at station, bike loading person at platform), my bike was loaded.&#xA0;Happy and grateful for a safe trip and for being able to do all that I wanted, I boarded the train to Bangalore :) The journey back home was very boring and painful - sitting idle for 33 hours was a pain after having a wonderful previous 10 days.&#xA0;Day 17BangaloreHotelsMapBecause my bike was also in the same train, I decided to collect my bike and return home. After an hour&apos;s wait at the platform after getting down from train, I got my bike and returned home :) My parents and brother were waiting for me and all the stories that I had to tell about this trip.&#xA0;The sunday was spent showing them all the photos and videos during my trip with a smile :)&#xA0;I am thankful for the friends I made during the trip, thankful for the people who helped me, also thankful to the people who prayed for my safe return and the many hospitable locals during the entire trip.&#xA0;",

		"Text": "Day 1La Tarasca was bustling with noise that Saturday afternoon; from customers eagerly waiting for seats, waitresses with their trays full, brisk walking and serving the orders to the tables and finally from foodies who were enjoying the rustic Mexican cuisine on their plates.&quot;How many of you?&quot; asked a petite but perky waitress.&quot;3 and a high chair,&quot; we replied, anxiously, as my 2 year old nephew had already started crying hangirly (No, that&apos;s not a legit word yet, but his mood that afternoon couldn&apos;t have been described any other way) way before the car pulled into restaurant&apos;s parking lot.Finally a table, and my brother grabbed the menu card. He ordered Quesadillas (fresh, homemade tortillas folded and filled with melted Morzzarella and Cotija cheese - as they describe it) for the little one along with Pollo Con Mole, Chile Colorado and Sopes for us, each of it with soft and tasty corn tortillas to go with. We wrapped up our great Mexican lunch with some Flan (P.S: They are to die for!).An hour and a half from after stopping for lunch, the four (three and a half, actually) happy souls were finally refueled with some delicious food and were back on the road that led us to Fern Creek, our homestay in Newberg.A single family house with well-done interiors, facing a picture perfect front lawn, along with an organic farm that had hens (with whom my nephew made friends) and where grew fresh vegetables, and a hot tub right as we were entering the portico - who wouldn&apos;t want to spend a wonderful weekend there!Oregon was predicted to have a cloudy day but luckily for us, it turned out to be a bright and sunny Sunday.We switched on our GPS, keyed in the destination and drove down to the extremely incredible family run vineyard that is said to have been established in the early 1990s.We tasted about five different kinds of wine at their winery which included Single Acre Tempranillo from 2013 and Dundee Hills Pinot Noir from 2010. But hands down, my favourite was the Dunde Hills Chardonnay from the famous green-skinned grape variety.We took advantage of the barbecue lunch they were serving and of the guy with the Polaroid camera who happily clicked a few shots for us, just for that nostalgic pleasure, before we got back to the homestay for a cat nap.After some quick shopping from Woodburn for our folks in India, ahem and for us too of course, our tastebuds started craving for some more of those tasty Mexican delicacies. So our next stop was invariably Luis&apos;s Taqueria, the diner that has been enjoying the limelight ever since Barack Obama walked in for lunch one fine afternoon in May 2008, while campaigning.There wasn&apos;t any better way to call it a day, than by jumping into the hot tub that was followed by an episode from Anthony Bourdain&apos;s show on TV.Waking up to Memorial Day morning, we decided to visit the Royal Rosarian Garden and the Portland Japanese Garden adjacent to that. Both the gardens were filled with people looking stress free.All arches were covered with colourful roses in all sizes and hues and the buds were stretching out to the blue sky, as if to greet the sun.Some were walking down the memory lane, holding on to their partner&apos;s hand as tightly as they could and the others were smelling the roses those were in full bloom; some were busy posing with the roses and the others happily clicking their photos.We also took a stroll through &quot;the most beautiful and authentic Japenese garden in the world outside of Japan&quot; according to Nobuo Matsunaga, the former Ambassador of Japan to the United States, who stated thus during his visit.It will definitely be one of those lively and vivid weekend trips I took in the US while it was also enlightening to know that Oregon was much more than just a state addicted to quacks and their celebrated Fighting Ducks!",

Marathas were forced to surrender this fort to Mughals in Treaty of Puranadare. Eventually the fort named as Lohagadh because iron was used in large proportion to build this fort.this fort is 89 km from Mumbai And 68 km from Pune, basically it is situated in lonavala . whichever mode you prefer in transportation you will enjoy because the route is full of adventurous at the amidst. bikers can come directly to lohagadh by taking help of local villagers and can reach at the base of the village lohawadigoing in group along with other adventurers , be prepare once you come and get the whole history of lohagadh , and come via private bus which is the best option. Many buses are available from mumbai to lonavala or pune to lonavala and from there you will get many private rickshaw or tam tam which will take you to lohagadh and are frequently available.apart from this my last option is train most convenient from Mumbai go to lonavala station or from Pune come back to Lonavala station and from their catch a local train to malavli station, andfrom malavli station lohagadh is just 9-10 km away. other fort which is close by is Visapur Fort.up above the lohagadh enclosed with fog\\we planned our journey during monsoon this time to get away from all heat and dirt which we acquired from the previous treks. This was our first monsoon trek and yes we really enjoyed this. we reached at the base of lohagadh at morning 400hrs, where we hired our private vehicle, we took a small nap over there got fresh it was morning 500hrs where all our group gathered around and started our way ahead to lohagadh, no one was there at that time and yes the way was started.the way to lohagadh is beautiful huge fort blessed with green grasses and iconic beauty of nature which make one to stay over there and have an whole night watching stars.my main motto is to keep the place clean as it is has huge historic background and to maintain its goodwill its our responsibility to keep it clean safe for other tourist and trekkers, Lohagadh is one of the simple trek for all age group.ganesh darwajahuge bricks lay laying high over this huge mountain and the robust door protecting this fort.getting knowledge of all this always mesmerized and always make me think about why this was being ruled by so many dynasties?The climate over here was very cool , fresh air breeze and no shoratge of water, you may find number of small shops over here as because it is simple trek for all age group and has iconic beauty itself so number of tourist and trekkers come here, usually this place is crowded so one must visit this place during September To March but we Decided to Go during monsoon and we found it very beautiful. best way to visit in monsoon is to go at early morning because after 9 crowd started increasing.while hiking on the top.and we glimpse towards this where we found small small things which was left behindon the fort there is small temple and one garve of muslim pir which is also known as sufi master. whileheading towrds the left of we found vinchu kada ohh yes which is also known as Scorpio Sting.Scorpio Sting Vinchu Kada\\Lohagadh is Itself famous for this vinchu kada and extra piece of cake over it, such a beauty of this which makes me realise heaven is here.There are many other picture which oftenly makes you feel like to visit this place again.water flowing from the top of the mountainwell along with me one more is enjoying the beauty and there is (Monkey)and this is how it looks from the topfog enclosed all around.well here is the Raja ShriChatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.After reaching top we had a good time and even crowed started increasing so we enjoyed each and every moment over there, small ponds on the way, where the way was empty during summer was filled with ponds and water started flowing and making there own way, flora and fauna i really don&apos;t want to come back but any how i came back, i was very thankful that we reached on time, we successfully completed our journey and returned back with the slogan Shri Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai!!!!",

Since 1st year of my lackluster B.Tech course seven of my friends and I have been going for a trip every year. My final semester was knocking on the door like a heavy rainfall on a tin shed .It would be parlous not to mention the names of my friends with whom I have had this great adventure. They are Prithwish , Arjaman , Kodali, Kaustav, Projjal,Ananda and Samson. We had booked our train tickets during Durga Pujo&#x2019;17.1st March, the day had come. Having travelled a lot with friends and solo my parents didn&#x2019;t even bother to drop me off at the station. We were vehemently waiting for the train to blow its whistle. The train was departing from Chitpur station, Kolkata and it was one of the cleanest stations I&#x2019;ve ever set my foot in. All eight of us, being residents of Kolkata&#x2019;s twin Howrah had no problem reaching the station within 1 hour before departure time.Train Name : KOAA Dibrugarh ExpressHow to Reach : Take a metro from any metro station at Kolkata and reach Shyambazar and take an auto from there or just call an uber/ola.Train departed at 8.55pm.After a exasperating night because none of us really let any of us sleep peacefully, they would make fake ticket check-ins and would tell jokes I can not even write. That is what trips with friends are for. We reached New Jalpaiguri Station at 8 am the next morning (2nd March). It was Holi. People of Siliguri were crashing eggs on each others&#x2019; heads with of course colours. Spared us as we were tourists .We booked an SUV and started our journey towards Gangtok.DAY 1:Gangtok , the capital of Sikkim , situated at higher altitude than that of Darjeeling( Which we had visited last year ) and we googled the temperature of Gangtok it showed 9 deg. The sikkimese driver knew a bit of Bengali , was wise enough to point the different paths that was diverging from a point , the paths that would go to Sikkim and Darjeeling. Few ID check ups at the border of West Bengal and Sikkim took place. A new driver took over of the vehicle from there. We were swirling, shivering across the narrow paths beside Teesta river. The clouds, the river running down was able to make us forget that we were sitting there for over 4 hours . The water of river was as green as the flag of Mexico. All of us, wanted to take a dip at the river , just feel the water and try to get some answers why it was so green , I don&#x2019;t know how a water can be green.I don&#x2019;t know. Looking for answers . The temperature eventually started decreasing and the clothes we were wearing started to increase. It was 10deg centigrade in Gangtok and rain started to pour, touched our bare face and we could feel the chilliness . Gangtok was as clean as any of the European cities we had watched in motion pictures. It did not have a single plastic on the roads or on the footpaths. Everything seemed to be so disciplined there, and we also realised our skins were getting try so a dab of moisturizer would fix that. Our hotel was Ma-Yang, It is situated near MG marg (2kms from it, you could get an cab or walk if you are fit, the roads are exceptionally steep). The most praiseworthy thing about our hotel was the view from my room which I shared with Kaustav and Ananda. You could the St. Thomas Church and Gangtok City Police station standing side by side and all the triangular shaped terraces steeping down like a staircase. Thought, it was cloudy and rain had stopped, you could see the clouds flying over the heads of the houses and huge things standing beyond the clouds.In the evening we visited MG Marg. It was mercurial. We had the famous thukpa from a local shop and it tasted like the best meal we&#x2019;ve ever had.DAY 2: Our SUV departed at 10 am for Lachen. Lachen is a situated in North Sikkim,one of the four district comprising Sikkim. The snake like road gave us a thrill of our lives and we encountered a waterfall every now and then. The green trees started appearing grey as we rode higher and higher through the roads. None of the vehicle blew their horn, how capable are the drivers there. Sometimes we could see nothing but blank space on the sides , we realised how high we were. Soon enough our vehicle was going through the clouds. We took 3 halts for eating and littering. Some of us were sleeping,some showed vomiting tendencies had to stop a while for them, finally reached Chungthang at 6pm. The sun was still emitting last bit of its light , which was enough for us to gulp the surrounding. We drank coffee, and was looking at the dam situated at the bank of the river flowing below. We were shaking in cold. The road became more wild and dangerous and any roller coaster would be ashamed seeing this road. At 9.30 pm we reached our Hotel, Jai Baba Loknath Hotel .DAY 3 : We woke up at 4am. All of us, ready to go for a long SUV ride, which was tiring,but in the ended always worth it, came out of our rooms and saw one of our friends pointing his finger at something by the window. So we went saw the most astonishing view of our lives. A mountain , more like a pyramid, standing top of a crowded fern trees, but glistening in silver as if dripped in unicorn blood. The moon was sparkling over it and despite numerous shouts from the driver, who by then was angry as his estimated departure time was vandalised by a group of 4th year students, him, being a 50 year old man,we watched it glow and stared at each others&#x2019; eyes ,gleaming, smiling with joy and were pretty obviously excited about the fact that this was just the beginning. . Within the 30 minutes of the journey we laid our hands on fresh snow and snow was falling down on us. It was the most crazily beautiful moment of our lives. This was our first snow fall experience. The friend with DSLR started doing his trickeries and we got some really fantastic pictures.We, also, started playing with snow balls. We got excited to the extent that we were playing like it was an Olympic sport and we were representing India. Every now and then one of us would point at a mountain the others would go &#x201C;ufff&#x201D;, &#x201C;omg&#x201D;. Finally the sun ray fell on our faces and we were just happy to be warm, the temperature being -6 deg that time ( a military personnel told us so). Our skins were going numb, no matter how much we tighten our scarfs or pull the beanie down our ears we would shiver . After 4 more hours we reached our destination for that day, Gurudongmar Lake, it is 17,789 ft high above sea level and as far as the driver showed confidence, it was -26 deg at 11 am on a day light. The wind was so fierce we could barely stand still, we went to see the lake running down from the suv and cordillera surrounded the lake, it was frozen , everything so white it almost blinded us. The wind was faster than Shoaib Akhtar&#x2019;s 161kph delivery. My friends who were smokers had some trouble breathing and had to take Camphor. While going back to our hotel we saw a minimum of 60 yaks walking on a ground covered with snow. We started our journey for Lacheng, another small village in North Sikkim and reached there at 6pm.DAY 4: Journey towards Yumthang Valley and Zero point began at 7 am next morning. The road was hilly and full of pot holes, the wind was strong. Our backs had gone sore after all these hours of hill ride We reached Yumthang valley ate momo at a local shop and joined a group of local over a bon fire and me, knowing how to play the guitar, sang Fix you, and I knew everyone had heard this song. The momo was cheap and delicious. it was veg,though. Then at the valley we were spellbound. We didn&#x2019;t expect there could me so much colour in this grey landscape. There were six or seven kinds of flowers. Some had white petals, some had violet berries hanging from it, we didn&#x2019;t know the name, but it was magical, like when you listen to a song and don&#x2019;t know what it says, but you still love it anyway, it was that kind of a feeling. The flower with yellow-reddish petals had a layer of snow on it, we took as much pictures as the stars in the sky and it was time to go for Zero point. Everything there at Zero Point was covered by snow. We played with snow balls, made a snow sculpture too, but was vandalised by a child&#x2019;s snow ball. After getting tired we sat there on the snow, not caring how our jeans would looks from the behind, and stared at the mountains. We saw mountains, standing side by side, some higher than the other but every one of them was equal in his own elegance, own enigma and reminded of the quote &#x201C;As high as a mountain&#x201D;.We went close to the edge just by the cliff we were hanging around and I could see small village, military base camps and small dots, resembling ants carrying food. We returned to Gangtok at 5pm that day.The next day we returned to NJP where our train would take us back to the land of joy, the city of joy. Our train was from 7pm on 6th March &#x2019;18. As the train engine rumbled and rambled on through the steel lines there was this feeling of joy and deliberation to have witnessed so much, to have explored the place I only heard stories about. I was also feeling a bit emotional as we had to leave but deep inside I knew I will be back here soon within 1 year to explore the uncovered parts. I thought of the lateritious colour of the flower of Yumthang Valley , a satisfactory grin filled my face . I needed a good night&#x2019;s sleep after this hectic journey before reaching home, where I could tell everyone our stories, the things we saw, the fun stories, the jokes amongst friends, incidents, events (which are so vulgar and confidential) of interminable laughter with friends. I was happy that I would see my Ma, Bapi and Chotu (Pet dog,more like a son) and rub my hand on this warm fur after a long time.&#x201C;Sure as I am breathingSure as I&apos;m sadI&apos;ll keep this wisdom in my fleshI leave here believing more than I hadAnd there&apos;s a reason I&apos;ll beA reason I&apos;ll be back&#x201D;Into The Wild, [ Sean Penn, Eddie Vedder]",

		"Text": "Day 1HimalayasHotelsMapWell to be honest, it is an experience which even words cannot describe. No matter how hard you try but there are certain moments which can only be felt when you live it.1. Getting out of your comfort zone and totally living a different life.* we&#x2019;re so busy living a monotonous life that we often forget that we are given a life to live and not just survive. Some of us are even scared to accept the change. Well trekking will take you to a totally different world. Where you&#x2019;ll have money but no where to spend. Where you cannot buy things you&#x2019;ve to earn it. Where your status won&#x2019;t matter but your kindness will. Where your profession won&#x2019;t matter but your ability will. Where your qualification will not talk but your positivity will. It will make you feel how blessed you&#x2019;re with a healthy life. 2. Take away your fears and give you strength at the same time.* We often underestimate our power because we have listened to people or by the fear of being judged. If talking about mountain life nobody is going to judge you,instead they&#x2019;ll push you towards your goal. Living that life for few days will make you realize you worry about problems which do not even matter. You&#x2019;ll surely face risk at every step and you&#x2019;ll fear more than you ever feared in life but every step taken further will leave you more powerful. Your inner self will push you towards achieving it and will introduce you with your strength. Making you realize you do not need anybody in life to achieve your goals,your power is enough.3. You can literally feel the divine power.* You&#x2019;ve to respect nature before loving it. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve learnt. Surely mountains are wild but it will leave you more softer. You will feel those vibes calling you again. You&#x2019;ll feel some kind of power is pulling you up not to show its superiority but to see you at the top,to give you happiness and to convey the message that there&#x2019;s a world which is continuously calling us and still were neglecting it for a luxurious life.4. The peace* &#x201C;Tranquillity&#x201D; that&#x2019;s what all talk about right? But some of us still do not know how that feeling is. Being near to nature is definitely a way of finding peace. But that Doesn&#x2019;t mean there will be no sound. You&#x2019;ll hear cold breeze giving a hush to your ears,the still sound of running stream,ringing of mule&#x2019;s bells,birds singing out loud,people talking their heart out,the roar of thunderstorm and even your &#x201C;sigh&#x201D; will give you music without disturbing your inner peace.5. Will switch your materialistic thoughts towards intellectual * We are addicted to luxury and materialistic things, our life is surrounded by easy to get things. But are rarely satisfied about those! Trekking will throw all the challenges at your face and after overcoming it, you&#x2019;ll feel immensely satisfied. you&#x2019;ll see world in a different way, you&#x2019;ll try to understand each and every aspect of life and moreover you&#x2019;ll succeed in it easily.6. Bring out humanity* We all are humans but very few of us show humanity. After experiencing a daunting and adventurous Trek, you&#x2019;ll feel how important it is for a human to act like one. You&#x2019;ll know the importance of the word &#x201C;Kind&#x201D;. Even localities will teach you what it feels like when someone helps you and be kind towards you. You&#x2019;ll not opt for this forcefully but by choice.7. Lastly you&#x2019;ll meet your soul * Our half of the life goes searching for our better half and forget we have our own soul also who needs love. It will introduce you towards self love. you&#x2019;ll start listening to your soul more and mind less. Trust me your souls speaks to you louder than your mind. All the positivity will start attracting towards it. Thank you for reading.Happy trekking :)",

		"Text": "Day 1New Delhi Railway StationHotelsMapBelieve me, it was the toughest one in every sense. Starting from the planning phase, choosing a trek, end moment train bookings to the trail, it was not an easy trip. It all started as soon as we got to know of a holi long weekend which was a week away. All 3 of us applied for an extra leave and started looking for a fruitful 4- day trip. We explored options such as Goa, Mumbai, Bir-Billing, Gangtok, and what not.Finally, we settled with Rishikesh and Nag Tibba. I know it sounds weird obviously after exploring exotic locations like Goa but last moment airfare hikes do this to your trip. So a piece of advice, please make your bookings in advance.You can check out some more interesting trips by clicking hereIt all started on Holi and we took an overnight train till Dehradun and pre-booked the trek with Himalayan Trekkers. The main reason for booking with some group was that the place is not commercialized like Triund or Kheerganaga, hence one has to carry all the hiking equipment with them. Since we are not the advance trekkers yet, so we decided to go with the group and the experience was really phenomenal.As soon as we reached Dehradun on Saturday morning, the taxi was already there waiting for us. There were other groups such as India hikes also who had tempo travelers there, where I also found one of my colleague whose name I don&apos;t know yet. Since she was a girl and that too a beautiful one, my friends didn&apos;t let go any event to mock me whenever they saw her on the trail.Day 2PantwariHotelsMapWe started our journey around 7AM when all seven members of the group gathered. I never knew that these strangers will become such good friends after a two-day trek.The Way It starts at Dehradun and the motorable road is there till Pantwari, which is around 2 hrs from Mussorie. Pantwari is a small village from where the trek starts. So it took us around 3.5 hrs before we were all set and started the journey after a fresh mouthwash at our trek leader&apos;s house. And very clearly he mentioned &quot;jisko karna hai yahin karlo upar nai milne vala&quot;.To give a background, it&apos;s a two-day trek which I don&apos;t know why comes under the category of easy treks by most of the groups. On the first day, one reaches the base camp which takes around 3-4 hrs while the summit and full descent are covered on the second day.The trailThe trail is not easy like the one in Kheerganga rather it is very steep and slippery. Also, you&apos;d need someone to assist on the way because it&apos;s confusing and you might end up taking a wrong route. So, for Nag Tibba at least I&apos;d recommend that it&apos;s better to go with a group.The trail is beautiful where you&apos;ll find some locals, carrying fodder, small waterfalls to refill your water bottles and scenic hilly terrain which would definitely make you stop for occasional photographs.The base camp It took us almost 4 hrs before we could see our tents on the base camp. It was on a hilltop where on one side there was a clear view of Pantwari village and on the other was the summit hidden somewhere in the clouds.As soon as we reached the base camp, the tents, water, and food were all there by the organizing group. They had small hut where they used to cook food and get there crockery from. They made sure that we were as comfortable and feel at home and served most delicious daal chawal, aloo sabzi, salad, papad and what not. The food was really tasty but it was their hospitality which made it more delicious. The tents were also comfortable with sleeping bags and strong enough to save us from heavy hilly rainfall and hailstorm. It was hardly two hrs after the lunch when I was in my tent and heard a voice that &quot;Sir, bahar aajao pakode, and chai tyar hai&quot;. I felt awesome and so special with the treatment because I knew there is nothing available here and everything is at least 3-4 hours of walk away. As the sun begins to set, we were clearly able to feel the drop in the temperature. Also, frequent showers made it a little difficult for us to get out from our tents and whether we should try going to the summit early morning or not because the trail will get slippery and if the rain continues it will be difficult to climb up and descend on the same day. But at least the local villager who was acting as our caretaker was optimistic that the clouds will shed and we&apos;ll be able to reach the &quot;summett&quot; (in his language) easily.As the darkness overpowered it was only the moonlight which was helping us find our way apart from torch lights which everyone was using either to go the toilet which was kind of open or sending signals to India hikes camps up the cliff.The nightThe night begins with the bonfire and a bottle of black-dog which one of my friends somehow was carrying from Delhi and was finally able to take it to the base camp after sneaking it past various security checks during the journey. That 1-1.5 hours near the bonfire actually brought the group closer and it never felt that we met this morning only. The day concluded when the caretaker invited us all to his small hut house-cum-room where they used to keep all the hiking equipment and other raw materials. Their hospitality and the happiness with which they were serving food actually made it delicious and made us realize that happiness is not in running around for things as we do in our daily city lives but in sharing and making others happy. The locals may have served the food and have done their duty but their affection for the strangers like us actually made the trip beautiful. Also, how can I forget the best Gulab Jamun&apos;s of my life which they served and prepared at the base camp itself. I had 3 Gulab Jamun&apos;s by the way.The summitDay 3Nag TibbaHotelsMap Finally, the day came and we were all excited to climb up the summit. And as the caretaker rightly said, the sky was almost clear and we started our ascend amidst little showers around 5AM. The trail was looking a little easier at the start but as we moved it became inclined and steep testing all our willpower and strength. After walking for almost 3.5 hours we reached the snow-covered top. I was able to clearly see the Indian flag with other groups all around clicking pictures. But to be true I expected the overall scenery a little more beautiful from the top, Though Himalayan range was visible, it wasn&apos;t as clear as one would expect after hiking for almost 8kms. So if its the view and destination you are looking for, Nag Tibba trek may disappoint you as compared to other two days trek where with a little easier trails you can experience a better view and a night stay at the top.After staying almost for 1.5 hours at the top and celebrating our achievements we begin our descent which was as difficult as climbing up because the trail was really steep and I was experiencing jerks in my knee while climbing down.It took us almost 2-2.5 hours to reach back at our base camp where we almost exhausted and the only thing which was keeping us alive was the thought of having Rajma Chawal in lunch. Also, you may not find at many places, but there is also a motorable road where you can get a taxi which will drop you back to Pantwari charging around Rs 700.The Best Part I think the best thing which I felt in these two days were the people around, be it the group members which quickly turned out to be friends or the locals such as our caretaker or our young trek leader who were always there making sure that we were comfortable and enjoying our journey. Also, the hospitality which I mentioned earlier is the one important takeaway which I mostly find missing from the people today in our cities.",

		"Text": "Day 1New DelhiHotelsMapYou must be wondering why such a title to this post. Does it mean I went for a office work alone and extended or I went in group with my other team members, left them instead and stayed back to experience the chilling Shimla weather in the month of December? So yeah its the later one as it sounds more adventurous.You check out some more interesting travel stories by clicking here.So we went there in a group of three (I, Devika and Dhiraj) to study Himachal Pradesh&apos;s Road safety system but believe me neither the road was safe and neither were we. Starting from the early morning experience of an absurd looking stranger with clumsy hair and wearing just an open jacket with his clearly visible bare chest trying hop into the back seat of our car to my near miss of being hit by a bus on a crowded chowk or searching for our hotel which was 8 kms away from the main city towards the jungle. There are enough stories to follow to prevent you from switching to other pages.The start We started our corporate trip on a thursday morning around 4:30 and took our office cab. Since we all were coming from three different parts of NCR, we decided to pick Dhiraj from the highway. So while we were waiting for him in the dark amidst little showers, I suudenly heard a sound of someone hitting our car&apos;s boot. We thought probably its him as he kept saying that he is just 10 mins away though he never was, but to our surprise someone else opened the backdoor. As I turned back to wish good morning to our respectable manager I realized that Devika a small 4 feet 30 Kg Senior consultant looked blue in fear with her mouth wide open. At the same time I heard someone saying from the other end saying &quot;Arre bhaiya bitha lo na&quot;. The stranger literally tried to enter the car and looked so weird and strange wearing just an open torn jacket with his bare chest completely visible.ShimlaHotelsMapThe way It took us almost 8 hours and we entered Shimla in the afternoon when I experienced a near miss by a rashly driven himachal local bus. The road till Chandigarh is really good and it takes around 3.5 hours to cover the 250 km distance but the remaining stretch is under construction which consumed most of the time.To my surprise it wasn&apos;t that cold in Shimla even in first week of December specially the day time which was sunny and clear. So after the lunch at local restaurant and after about 3 hours of meeting with Himachal PWD people it was the time to hit the famous and highly commercialized mall road. So around 5:30 when sun was about to set there was a beautiful orange glow coming from the mountains and the cold breeze made us realize that winter is coming. Also even on a working Thursday the mall road had that rush and buzz which reminded me of my summer holiday in my old school days when Shimla was one of the most exciting holiday option. Since it was Dhiraj&apos;s first visit to Shimla and he had just that day, the only restaurant and the eating joint I was able to think was the iconic Ashiana Restaurant. Situated on the ridge, the most beautiful architecture and heart of Shimla along with the church and Gandhi Statue is the this restaurant. Its one of the oldest which may have upgraded there menu from purely Indian authentic food to pizza and pasta but its surely a must visit just because its so old.We ordered veg cutlet, pizza and soup as we went a little earlier and the main course wasn&apos;t available.The haunted drive After dropping Dhiraj at the bus stop, I and Devika headed towards our hotel which was like 8 kms away from the mall and present somewhere in the Jungle. The road was all empty with no presence of street lights or any lights for that matter. I don&apos;t know why all my rides turn haunted and scary when I head towards my hotel. The experience became more adventurous when the hotel we booked was locked and there was no one around. We looked at each other in a surprise and felt stranded on a haunted road in a jungle with no where else to go. But soon the care taker came and welcomed us in the hotel.Day 2ShimlaHotelsMapIt started the next day when Devika also left taking the cab as well in the second half after a 2 hour long meeting at HP police. I checked into my dad&apos;s guest house in a suspense whether the care taker and the cook will accept me as their guest but they were happy to welcome me and even cooked maggi.Wake and BakeAfter getting something into my tummy, it was the time to hit the mall road and explore, and what could have been a better way to start other than the famous caf&#xE9; &quot;Wake and bake&quot;. Situated at the famous scandal point it&apos;s a caf&#xE9; which gives a perfect view of the mall road through its yellow colored windows and also has a terrace with a beautiful Himalayan range view. I tried the famous carrot cake and Italian sandwich surely was filling and justified all the reviews available on trip advisor.When you are alone you tend to do and experience things which otherwise you may hesitate or resist. The next experience was the a theatrical play titled &quot; Taj Mahal ka tender&quot; which was organized and presented for the Himachal police in the geity theatre and was free for anyone to attend. I thought that probably I&apos;ll sit for some time and will sneak out, but to my experience the play was so exceptional with perfect dialogue delivery, lights and sound that I kept sitting for next two hours and enjoyed. This is actually you could do once you are on your own roaming here and there, talking to people, eating chocolates and coming back late to hotel with no one to question and interrogate.So after the play I also clicked few pictures, checked out girls on the ridge road, ate 2-3 crackles on the way back and when almost everything got shut and the cook called that my Shahi paneer is waiting, I returned.Shimla being the capital city is highly commercialized and few places to go such as Jakhu Temple, Christ church, Kufri, Narkanda etc. But since it was my 6 th trip to Shimla I didn&apos;t really wanted to go there again. Instead next morning I headed towards rather rustic church know by the name &quot;Cathedral church&quot; was suggested by one of my traveler friend. It was actually very really beautiful, peaceful and unexplored.For the remaining time whatever I had I just stood on the mall road&apos;s end feeling the breeze and admiring the majesty Himalayan beauty realizing that these are something immortal and were there even when I visited in my childhood, are here now and will be there when I would be no more.Being a consultant I am getting habitual of analysing the take away&apos;s of my each visit. And from this visit I can surely say that, one should try to travel solo atleast once just to experience the independence, the calmness and see whether you can fill that void own your own and with no one else being in your life. Because no matter what, everyone at some point or the other will leave you permanently or temporarily, hence it&apos;s very important that you are comfortable with your own self because a person can live with someone else only and only if he can live with himself.",

		"Text": "As soon as any long weekend approaches, most of us start formulating our plans of spending it with our friends or family, start exploring possible options where we can drive and form whatsapp groups. But most of the time it gets cancelled by some or the other reason. Similarly on Gandhi Jayanti long weekend we thought of going somewhere and after so much thought we decided Nainital as our final destination.\nDay 1DelhiHotelsMapYou can read about my other travel stories here.We started our trip on a Saturday early morning and left Delhi around 4 AM. To our expectation most of the Delhi folks were having the same plans, hence all the hustle- bustle was clearly visible even in the early morning.Road to Nainital is amazing apart from 50km stretch between Delhi and Hapur, which is under construction. There are many ways to reach Nainital but we decided to take the Bajpur route which passes through outs-curds of dense Jim Corbett National park. We entered Nainital around 11:30 AM where a policemen welcomed by making us take a longer route and a lot of detours and risking our life by driving on narrow hilly roads.NainitalHotelsMapThe stay Since it was a long weekend, most of the hotels were already booked but we managed to book a home-stay through airbnb which was probably the best stays I ever had on the hills. Situated on a hilltop P&apos;s Home-stay has around 7-8 independent inter connected room with a beautiful view of Naini-lake. It is managed by an old couple who try hard to make your stay as memorable by providing everything you might need in return of 5-10 min chat with the aunt. Once you have a great tuning with her, you won&apos;t have to worry about the delicious breakfast and the morning tea. The first day was mostly at leisure and since it was Dusshera, most of the locals were out in the market and mall road. Nainital celebrates this day with a lot of enthusiasm by organizing rath yatra which passes through the mall road. Locals are dressed in various characters of Ramayana cheering Lord Rama&apos;s victory over evil.The whole town was so energetic and colorful, we decided to skip the local tourist spots such as the cave garden, zoo and hill view and instead spent time taking a ferry in the lake and witnessing Dusshera celebration. The best part was the fire cracker show which lasted for more than 1 hour. It was beautifully synchronized and organized and was comparable to any of the famous city&apos;s new year fir cracker celebration all over the world. Locals are really helpful and our helmsman made us realize that how much they enjoy their work and try hard to make tourist&apos;s experience as nostalgic as they can. He gave us a full ride in the lake in his &quot;Shikara&quot; which was apparently named after his girlfriend, along with some life gyan which was really enriching.Heading to MukhteshwarDay 2MukteshwarHotelsMapSince we had just one day left we decided to leave our home-stay early after breakfast and headed towards Ramgarh. Ramgarh is a village located around 25kms from Nainital. It doesn&apos;t has much to look for apart from few local shops but the road trip and the scenic Himalayan view is incomparable. Thus instead of stopping we headed towards Mukhteshwar which is famous for Shiva temple.At just 500 metres from Mukhteshwar temple lies a Inspection bungalow which most if the people are not aware of, and yes thanks to one of my friend we were able to visit that. The Bungalow is situated probably at the one of the best location with a huge lawn in front and an amazing view of Nanda devi hill range. Also it serves awesome food which is a must have along with the view.Towards Bhimtal We left Mukhteshwar around 3:30 PM and drove as rashly as we could to reach one of the best cafes known as Cafe by the lakes. But in-spite of all the rush by the time we were there it was already closed.Other cafes:i hearts-: its famous for shakes, pancakes, pastries. But this also went out of stock by the time we entered.Bird-Sound Cafe: This was finally the one which was open and had some food to offer. Food wasn&apos;t that good but its a worth try as it offers a big lawn and is located amidst the hills. The owner was very interactive too and gave us a guitar to play in return for good review on tripadvisor.Haunted Return By the time we decided to head back to our home-stay it was already 9 PM. We covered almost 20 km of dark stretch with almost no human presence and zoological signboard welcoming us with a picture of Leopard every 500 Meters. And thanks to one of my friend who was resembling like a werewolf whenever a car was approaching from the opposite side with a high beam.After a lot adventure of our car stopping the hilly inclination to my friends leaving me among dogs on a solitary roads, we somehow managed to reach our home around 11 with a breezer in one hand and a bacardi in another.All in all the trip was a lot of fun with near death experiences.Best partThe best part were these two made it adventures and memorable, be it discussions, office bitching during the late night drinks, giving near death experience by driving rashly, from their song collections to finishing my food, since I am never able to eat much.",

		"Text": "A chain of islands in the remote reaches of the Pacific Ocean inspired a man to give us &apos;The Theory of Evolution&apos;. Also known as Darwin&apos;s Eden and the Wild Wild Wonderland, the &#x200A;Gal&#xE1;pagos Islands are truly unique and remarkable. Here, humans, animals, birds, marine beings and plants all live in harmony. You get to swim with sharks and stingrays, spot penguins, admire the blue of the blue-footed boobies, get up close to the sea-lions and seals, awe at the colours of rainbow crabs, witness the grace of giant tortoises and observe many other members of the animal kingdom.\nGalapagos IslandsHotelsMapA Week in The Wild KingdomSanta CruzHotelsMapI spent a week between the three main islands of Galapagos - &#x200A;Santa Cruz Island, &#x200A;Isabela Island, and &#x200A;San Crist&#xF3;bal Island. A week is a decent time to experience and admire the majestic beasts of the underworld as well as our land-dwelling cousins.The airport that serves Santa Cruz Island is actually in &#x200A;Baltra Island. From the airport, a combination of bus and boat (US$5) took me to the primary tourist town of &#x200A;Puerto Ayora in Santa Cruz Island.Day 1Puerto AyoraHotelsMapAfter checking into my hotel, I headed straight to the &#x200A;Charles Darwin Research Station to get face to face with the gentlest and one of the giant-est reptiles - the Gal&#xE1;pagos tortoise. They are the largest living species of tortoise on the planet. Their size is beyond imagination but it is their gentle nature that really warms the heart. From there, I went for some snorkeling at &#x200A;Playa de la Estacion (free). The water was murky and I didn&apos;t really see anything.Day 2Tortuga BayHotelsMapOn the second day, I walked 2.5km to the finest stretch of golden sand and turquoise water around Puerto Ayora, &#x200A;Tortuga Bay (free). Tortuga Bay has two beaches, the first one you encounter is good for surfing while the other one Playa Mansa is a calm bay good for snorkeling. Snorkeling around the mangroves is a unique experience and you stand the chance to see white-tip sharks close to the mangroves. Snorkeling mask and fins are available for rent at travel agencies in Puerto Ayora.The real highlight of the Tortuga Bay is the marine iguanas. Marine iguanas are a prime example of evolution and adaptation. Millions of years ago, land-dwelling iguanas drifted out to sea from continental South America to arrive in Galapagos. Due to a lack of food on land, they started venturing into the ocean giving us the evolved species of marine iguanas. To this day, marine iguanas only exist in the Galapagos Islands. On your way back look out for Darwin&apos;s Finch and Lava Lizard.Las GrietasHotelsMapAfter Tortuga Bay, I visited &#x200A;Las Grietas (US$2), a craggy canyon with crystal clear water. Snorkeling in between two tall cliffs makes you admire the forces of nature at work. &apos;Grieta&apos; means crevasse or crack since millions of years ago forces of nature cracked the hill into two cliffs that you are swimming in.How to travel between the islandsThere are daily direct ferries (US$30 one-way/US$50 round-trip) from &#x200A;Santa Cruz Island to &#x200A;San Crist&#xF3;bal Island and &#x200A;Isabela Island. The travel time varies based on weather and ocean condition. It is indeed a bumpy boat ride. Those who don&apos;t prefer the open ocean can fly between the islands with one of the inter-island jet carriers.Day 3Isabela IslandHotelsMapOn my third day in the Galapagos, I took the morning ferry (7am) to &#x200A;Isabela Island. As I disembarked in &#x200A;Puerto Villamil, the main town in Isabela Island, I was greeted by the sight of seals relaxing on benches and beaches.Playa IsabelaHotelsMap  \tAfter checking into my hotel, I went to &#x200A;Playa Isabela to snorkel. As I was meditatively snorkeling in the water, a tiny creature sped by me. I got a glimpse of its black skin and what looked like wings-cum-hands. My curiosity led me to stay still and wait for it to pass again. And pass it did. My heart skipped a beat as a sense of accomplishment pass through it on seeing the Galapagos Penguin, the northernmost penguins in the world. I turned into a child in a candy store. I could ask for no more. Late afternoon and evening is the best time to see the Galapagos Penguin around Playa Isabela.Day 4Concha de PerlaHotelsMapHaving recovered from the euphoria of the Galapagos Penguin, I walked for five minutes to &#x200A;Concha de Perla. The water here is calmer and clearer. I saw a wide variety of colourful fishes and some fellow snorkelers also spotted a stingray. Overall, I really enjoyed snorkeling at Concha de Perla. Snorkeling mask and fins are available for rent right at Playa Isabela. After Concha, I went to book a day tour to &#x200A;Las Tintoreras Islet, the most famous destination around Isabela Island. The day tour costs somewhere between US$80-100 based on the season. Before heading to the hotel, I went to &#x200A;Los Flamencos to see some flamingos in the pond.Las Tintoreras IsletHotelsMap  \tLittle did I know that my fourth day in Galapagos will be the one I will remember for years to come. The tour boat with 11 other travelers took us to small islets in the Pacific Ocean. One of the many volcanic islets housed one of nature&apos;s masterstroke, a blue-footed booby. It seemed like a bird just flew out of an Audubon painting. Giving company to the blue-footed booby were Galapagos penguins. At such moments one realizes the poetry that is life.The mind had barely processed the beauties of land and flight and the captain asked us to jump into the underworld. We swam amidst colourful fishes searching for Nemo. But, what we found instead was much larger and scarier. I gasped for breath as the guide excitedly pointed to two white-tip sharks swimming barely few feet beneath us. Despite knowing the harmless nature of the white-tips, my body froze as Jaws and all came to mind. Later, we dived in to take a peek at 20 odd sharks resting in an underwater cave. Goosebumps! We also spotted stingrays, turtles, and seahorses. As we got on the boat still digesting what we saw, we were served lunch. Our tour boat got us back in time for me to catch the afternoon ferry back to Santa Cruz.TIP: If you plan to take the afternoon ferry back to Santa Cruz, confirm with your tour operator that you will get back in time to catch the ferry.Day 5San CristobalHotelsMapOn the fifth day, I took the morning ferry from Santa Cruz Island to &#x200A;San Crist&#xF3;bal Island. San Cristobal Island is my personal favorite because it is less touristy and more authentic. You can actually feel and experience the Galapagos life here.Playa LoberiaHotelsMapAfter checking into my hotel in the main town of &#x200A;Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, I took a taxi to &#x200A;Playa Loberia Beach (free), home to a large sea lion colony. At this beach, mother sea lions teach their little ones how to swim. Therefore while snorkeling, you are bound to come across sea lion cubs coming close to you to figure out what kind of a creature you are.Mirador Cerro TijeretasHotelsMapI took a taxi from Playa Loberia to the &#x200A;Interpretation Center and walked rest of the way to &#x200A;Mirador Cerro Tijeretas. This is where you can see the frigate birds, known for their inflated red throat pouch, flying in the sky. The bay below the viewpoint is the best free snorkeling in all of the three islands. Crystal clear calm water teeming with colourful fishes, turtles, sea lions, and rays. I spent hours snorkeling here. Also look out for rainbow crabs of different colors on the banks of the bay. On your way back to the town stop by at &#x200A;Playa Punta Carola to witness the sun setting into the Pacific amidst the yachts and boats. Before heading to the hotel, I booked a day tour to &#x200A;Kicker Rock. Kicker Rock day tour costs around US$100.Day 6Kicker RockHotelsMapEarly next morning, the tour boat sailed for Kicker Rock, a natural cathedral rising out the ocean. We jumped into the ocean near the Rock. Swimming in the cold waters of the Pacific, I suddenly felt the warmth of life and teardrops of joy dropped in the salty water as my breath was taken away by a pod of dolphins swimming next to me. It was another one of those &apos;life is beautiful&apos; moments. Swimming along, we saw a large school of golden rays swimming synchronously. As we made our way back to the boat, we saw a spotted eagle ray flying majestically in the depths of the Pacific. You can also see Galapagos sharks and hammer-heads around Kicker Rock. Back on the boat, I solemnly admired the ocean and its deep secrets.Again, the boat got us back to Puerto Baquerizo Moreno in time to catch the afternoon ferry back to Santa Cruz Island.TIP: If you fly into Santa Cruz Island then it is better to fly out of San Cristobal Island or vice versa. This gives you an extra day to explore.Farewell the Wild and the FreeDay 7Santa CruzHotelsMapOn the seventh and last day, I woke up early to catch the bus to the airport. There is only one bus from Puerto Ayora to the Baltra Airport at 7am. There are of course taxis that can take you to the airport. The islands of Galapagos will hold a special place in my heart till I walk and wander this beautiful planet of ours. Follow in the footsteps of Darwin and let the wild wonderland of Galapagos inspire you.Visa for the Galapagos IslandsGalapagos Islands are part of Ecuador. And, Indians don&apos;t need a visa to travel to Ecuador. A tourist card is given on arrival at the airport which is valid for 90 days.When to visit the Galapagos IslandsThe best time to visit Galapagos Islands is from December to June. Temperature ranges between 20 to 30 Celsius and the seas are calmer with better visibility during these months.How to reach the Galapagos IslandsBy air: Round-trip ticket from New Delhi to Quito, Ecuador cost &#x20B9;91,816. There are direct flights from Quito to Santa Cruz and San Cristobal islands.Where to stay in the Galapagos IslandsCasa de Jeimy, San Crist&#xF3;bal (&#x20B9;2,225 for double), Hotel Neptuno, Isabela (&#x20B9;2,008 for double) and Hostal Gardner, Santa Cruz (&#x20B9;2,781 for double).

		"Text": "It was August which meant the monsoon was relentless and the Western Ghats meant only one thing; incessant rains, lush mountains and valleys with spectacular water falls. The pluvilophile in me was itching to get high with the smell of petrichor.\nDay 1NasikHotelsMapThe damned GPS!The google map showed an estimated journey time of a little over one and a half hour. But time and again, the google map and the weak internet connection meant there was practically no use of the GPS. So with music blasting from our dashboard stereo, we decided to do away with the GPS and resort to the old fashioned Indian way of asking our way; onward to Bhandardara.GhotiHotelsMapThe overcast skies and greens on the way to Bhandardara.My friend at the helm had hit the gas, zipping at over 80 km per hour over the highway for about an hour. The last half an hour though was more of a slog than a dash, over pock marked tarmac, through lashing rain, and low visibility driving negotiating gentle bends to Bhandardara.For tourists, looking for a sightseeing tour with a checklist of &#x201C;must see and must do&#x201D;, I am afraid Bhandardara is a disappointment. But thankfully for me, there were places that were still &#x201C;unpolluted&#x201D; selfie-maniacs. Bhandardara is a place where Your imaginations run wild, You get intoxicated by the unpolluted air and a place to get both the body and the soul drenched.And that&#x2019;s what we exactly did, got drenched, at Arthur Lake. By the banks, there are a few ramshackle shops selling snacks to the hordes of tourists that flock to Bhandardara during the monsoon. We picked up a few edibles, scouted for a secluded place on the banks, far from the selfie hungry crowd and sat there munching away on the snacks watching the clouds rolling in over the distant peaks. The lake changed shades as and when the clouds flew overhead, from sparkling white to ominous, monstrous shades of grey. While in the Shayadris, it is impossible to escape getting wet, and from nowhere the rain came; catching us off guard. Even before we had the time to put on our slickers, we were soaked.We rushed to the very shack from which we had bought the finger food earlier. The rain and the gusts made it chilly, even in August. Sitting by the shack&#x2019;s stove, we warmed ourselves; sipping tea while waiting for the rain to subside.From the Arthur lake, the road forked, one went toward the Randha falls while the other led to the centuries old Amruteshwar temple. We decided to take the left flank first, on to the falls. Driving for 8 more kilometres through lush paddy fields stepped on the hills, we reached the gorging Randha falls. Having a height of 170 feet, Randha falls is a situated on Pravara river, the main river flowing through the region. Like a stubborn, naughty kid, the falls made its way through the hills forming a deep gorge. On the way back from the falls, we paid a visit to the ancient Amruteshwar temple. 17 kilometres from Bhandardara, in the village of Ratanwadi, the Amruteshwar Temple is an intricately carved temple dedicated to Shiva. The surrounding mountains draped in their emerald cloak with the cape dark monsoon clouds rendered a mystical charm to the temple.After paying our divine respects to the lord, we started to descend. On the way back to Nashik, we stopped at the century old Wilson dam. Build in 1910 across the Pravara river the 150-meter high dam is one of the largest earthen dams. The opening of sluice gates creates two 60 to 80 feet cascades of water that plummet to the rocks below. It&#x2019;s a spectacular view. There is a garden at the base of the dam where tourists can amble about.Bhandardara-Dam(wilson Dam)HotelsMapBut, Bhandardara is beyond these &#x201C;points of tourist attractions&#x201D;. It is the hidden gem of the Shayadris, which is slowly starting to reveal itself to the travellers who seek to find beauty in the wild, beyond the cacophony of the hyped hill stations. A place which is a paradise for dreamers, who like to waste time thinking, pondering and ambling over overgrown trails. Bhandardara is a place to camp, to soak in the solitude, to gaze at the stars, the milky way and a place to search the depths of the soul to seek the real person hidden deep within.Fact File:How to reach: Bhandardara lies about 165 kilometers from Mumbai, just after Igatpuri. It is well connected by road and rail, the nearest rail head being Ghoti.&#xA0;Stay: There are a few resorts in Bhandardara with Anandvan Resort and Yash resorts being the most acquainted.Things to do: There is not much sightseeing to be done in Bhandardara. But there are lots of scope for camping and trekking. The famous Sandhan Valley trek can be done from here. During non-monsoon days, it is a great place for stargazing.",

Our flight was different, but to our amaze it landed at almost same time. Then we had 1 hour journey from airport and headed to our hotel Cygnett Inn Celestial which is near to Calangute beach and around 40 km. Then in morning, we had an amazing buffet breakfast which includes chicken sandwich, grilled veggies and chicken and coffee, ofcourse as I am a coffee lover. Then we hired a scooty and started for beaches(though then we had no idea where we are going). You can get a scooty at 350-400 bucks per day basis. We just opened google map and started driving. First, we went Anjuna beach which is around 10 km. And it was splendid. The scenic view was mesmerizing. We had our temporary tattoo there. It only cost around 300 bucks. Then we sat for sometime and just watched the crazy waves. Then we went for Chapora fort which is again around 10 km. We get lost in middle and accidentally went to Chapora river. And it was again a beautifull view. Goa was green everywhere as it was Rainy season. Chapora fort is famous for &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; shooting. And it has the most amazing view I had seen in Goa. And the wind there was uncontrollable. Then we went to Vagator beach which is nearby only. For sometime we sat there, clicked photos and came back to our hotel. At night we went for dinner to a restro cum bar Jazz House. If you been there, you should not miss rhere flavoured hukkah and fenny(local alcohol). In food you can try Lobster pops or Crab balls. Sizzler was also good there. We enjoyed live music there upto 12. Then we returned to our hotel.Cappuccino timeAnjuna beachFish n chipsAnjuna beachGoa at nightChapora RiverView from Chapora fortView from roadVagator beachVagator Beach from Chapora FortHukkah????Day 2In the 2nd day, we woke up late as we both were very tired. So we thought of visiting nearby places only. We first went to Candolim beach. Then we went for Calangute Beach. We enjoyed in the sea and had bath there. Then we tried some local Goan food for lunch. It was a sea food combo which costs aroud 700 bucks and includes rice, fish fry, prawns, crabs, squids and oysters. The gravy were spicy ones as Goan dishes are bit spicy, but it yasted so pure and good. It has mainly coconut in its gravy. Then after lunch we went for Aguada fort which is around 8 km from the beach. The road was awesome there. Then we found a beach Onix beach just near the fort. We suddenly saw a Church on the way, and visited there. It has some scenic view and peace. Then we went for Sinquerium beach which is on the way back to our hotel. I think this particular beach has amazing view. We found a dead porcupine on the beach there!!!!! We tasted some roasted corn there with green chutney and it tasted like heaven. Again we went for dinner to the same place. Enjoyed live music. Then we went for night market at Arpora. Only Saturday the market is opened. You can find literally anything there!! I bought tshirts and tops each one only around 200-300 bucks. You can find varieties of jewellery there which are very cheap. But you have to burgain a lot. I did shopping for all my friends and relatives. And we went back to our hotel.ChurchRock and seaAguada FortSinquerim beachDay 3Third day, we thought of exploring Old Goa. So we started early for Basilica Of Bom Jesus which is aeound 22 km. Old Goa is something you must explore. It is purely heritage. The old houses, greenary, churches made me lost in the history. The architecture is amazing there. Then we went for St. Augustin Tower. This is something I found very magical. It is almost destroyed but whatever is preserved, through this history wants to talk with you. I personally liked this place. It has some historical magic within it. Then we had luch at a local restaurant and went for Colva beach which is 32 km from there. The road was amazing, needless to say. The Beach is perfect for bathing. We did not have time though. So we sat there, relaxed for some time and came back as we had to travel around&#xA0; 46 km from there. When we reached our hotel, it was already evening. Then we went for local market and had early dinner as we have early morning flight next day. And our Goa trip ended with this.Basilica of Bom JesusBasilica of Bom JesusColva BeachBasilica Of Bom JesusSt. Augustine TowerSt. Augistine TowerSt. Augustine TowerCruise..History..",

		"Text": "PatanHotelsMapIn the midst of an ancient fortified town, Patan, lies one of the most beautiful excavated architectural place built in 11th century built under the instructions of Queen Udayamati. It was built in the memory of Bhimdev I, the son of Mularaja, the founder of the Solanki dynasty of Anahilwada Patan by his widowed queen Udayamati. Later the step well was used to store water for the village. It was structured in 7 steps so that storage of water will be easier to collect and maintain.It is also said that a man accidentally fell into the hole and to save him, people had to dig the ground and that is how Rani ki Vav was discovered.When one takes the first look of the place, all that can be seen is a step well with lush green surroundings which is well maintained. But when one starts climbing the steps, the beautiful carvings on the wall leaves you amazed. Most of the carvings are of gods, other than that the windows are also designed remarkably. There is also a small gate below the last step of the step well, with a 30 kilometre tunnel (currently blocked by stones and mud) which leads to the town of Sidhpur near Patan. It was used as an escape gateway for the king, who built the step well in the times of defeat.The best time when one can visit the place is during &#x201C;RANI KI VAV FESTIVAL&#x201D; also known as &#x2018;Water Festival&#x2019; locally. During this festival the step well is decorated spectacularly, and during evenings &#x2018;Diyas&#x2019; are lit all over the place. The festival takes place annually either in December or January.Some of the highlights of the Rani Ki Vav festival are Special lighting and d&#xE9;cor at the site, Cultural Programmes of Dance and Music, Setting up of a market for street shopping of local products, Food festival offering the most exquisite local cuisines and Exhibition of local arts and crafts.Why not visit the pace where The Queen ruled and did a great work for the people of the town. Mr. Amitabh Bachan says &#x201C; Khushboo Gujarat ki, come breathe in some air of Gujarat&#x201D;, So let&#x2019;s agree with him for once, and breathe in some air of Patan!2 h 27 min (125.6 km) via Ahmedabad - Palanpur Highway Rd/Ahmedabad - Patan Highway RdRani ki Vav Festival",

		"Text": "It all started a month back when I first read about the longest lunar eclipse of the century, happening at the end of July. I thought of going for a trek to witness the eclipse from a beautiful mountain peak and a less light polluted sky. But to my disappointment I couldn&#x2019;t find any treks organized during the eclipse. I did not give up and kept searching every other day until one day I stumbled upon an event, which was specially curated for this eclipse.This event was organized at a place called Masinagudi, close to Mudumalai National Park, by an amateur astronomer who has been working in this field from the past 15 years. This was even better than what I had in mind and so I registered myself for this event.The start of the trip itself was one of a kind. We took a bus, which passed through a forest after midnight. It was a 30 km stretch through the dense forest. No vehicles were allowed after 6pm to morning 6am except for government volvos. I was sitting in the first seat, getting a full 180-degree view of the forest. Ours was the only bus on the road, it was pitch dark and he was driving at 10km/hr. Everybody was fast asleep and one could only hear the sound of the forest. I had passed through that forest during the daytime in the past and had seen many animals, but since it was past midnight this time, I did not expect to see anything. However, to my surprise, even at 3am the forest was so lively. I saw a dozen of elephants, bisons, rabbits and deers, grazing and roaming around as if it was daytime. Whenever the headlights of the bus would fall on them, they would look back at us with their luminous eyes. It was eerie but beautiful.We reached Ooty in the morning and took a local bus back to Theppekadu. From there it was just 7 kms. We checked-in at a place called Tamarind Tree. It was a simple and a beautiful place with a mesmerizing mountain view. The telescope was installed next door at a place called Bamboo Banks. This was a huge and extremely beautiful property. Because of the proximity to the forest, you could see deers, malabar squirrels and others passing right by your room. During the night, however, wild elephants, tigers, bears also entered the property and hence it was advised to not leave the room after 12.My room at Tamarind Tree, MasinagudiSmall verandah outside the room and the mountain viewWe started our morning roaming around the place and having delicious lunch at Bamboo banks. In the afternoon, we went up a cute little tree house and had discussions with the astronomer. He was an encyclopedia of astronomy. He had so much to share and teach. He told us about his work and how astronomy has changed him as a person and how beautiful it is to gaze up to the sky. He also showed us an artificial satellite taking a trip of our planet. You can usually spot them near dusk or dawn.Tree house at Bamboo Banks, MasinagudiView from the TreehouseView from the TreehouseIn and around Bamboo BanksIn and around Bamboo BanksLater, we all eagerly waited for the Sun to set and geared up for our night session. The telescope was installed in a small shed observatory with a Roll-Off roof, a little far away from the rooms. The owner advised us to either wrap up the session by 1am at the latest or else spend the whole night in the observatory, since it was not safe to go out later in the night. Few of us decided to stay back and others decided to leave early.This telescope was a piece of art. You just needed to enter your date and time, and select the object you want to see, and it would automatically point to that object. This was the first time I had seen a telescope in my life and I was thrilled beyond measure.The Shed ObservatoryThe first object we saw was Jupiter. A beautiful, round Jupiter with its bands of clouds and its moons, three of them! I, who had not even looked through a binocular before, cannot describe in words what it was like to look through this telescope, at a planet as humongous as Jupiter. Even while writing this, I am getting goosebumps. I was elated!Next, we saw a binary star. A binary star is a system of two stars in which one star revolves round the other or both revolve round a common center. Most binary systems look like a single star when viewed with only the naked eye. Then we moved to Saturn, the magnificent planet with its equally beautiful rings. We also spotted four of its moons including Titan. The image was so clear and detailed that we could also see the Cassini division. After that, we saw Mars, which looked like a small tennis ball, and finally the eclipsing Moon! Not anything I say to describe the beauty of the Moon would do justice to it. It was that splendid. Even with the naked eye, the sky, the stars and the moon looked so bewitching. The atmosphere also added to it. It was just 4&#x2013;5 of us now. It was dark, extremely quiet and a bit scary. Around 3am, two of us came out of the shed to freshen up, since the bathroom was a 100mts far. It seemed like we were the only one there, but as soon as I flashed the light, I saw around 50 deers, at a distance of just 10 feet, looking right back at me with their shining eyes. They froze, and so did we, and after a while they just slowly walked away. This was another exhilarating moment. We tiptoed our way to the restroom, came back to the shed as soon as possible, and continued with our observations. When the clouds would play a spoilsport, we would retire to the chairs and take a powernap. Finally, at 6am, we returned to our rooms and made up for the night&#x2019;s sleep.Eclipsing MoonMoon with all its glorySaturnThe other day we learnt to read a star chart, had lunch to our heart&#x2019;s content, and lazed around. I decided to sit at the dining area at Tamarind tree and have a cup of coffee. Since most of the people had left to visit Ooty during the day, the place was nearly empty. I was sitting alone and listening to the birds chirping. There was a slight drizzle, which made the mountains, and the surroundings look even more fascinating. To add to this beautiful moment, was a wind chime which sounded music to the ears, blowing in the gentle breeze. I saw a variety of birds, and in a good number, flying, chirping and playfully fighting with each other. The person, who manages the place is a naturalist and has turned the place to a small bird sanctuary. Every time I tried to come even slightly closer to them, they would fly away. Therefore, I decided to just sit, and let them come to me to get a closer view. I spent hours just looking at them, and the mountains, sipping coffee and immersing myself in the sounds of the wind chime and the surroundings. It felt like the time stood still.Dining area at Tamarind TreeAs the day turned into night, we prepared ourselves for yet another session with the stars. This time it was only the three of us. I had learnt to operate the telescope all by myself by now. We started with binary stars. Cute little pairs to look at, some golden, some blueish white, some pairs of different sizes and some twins, looking exactly the same, like cat eyes, some at a little distance apart, some very close to each other. Then we moved to Mars and had a detailed look. We saw something shiny on the top, which could have been the polar ice caps, and later we were back to the moon. The moon was a spectacular sight with its lunar mares and hundreds of visible craters and some very bright spots. The image was so sharp that you could see every detail of the moon&#x2019;s surface with their outlines. Since it got hazy later, we could not see much, other than the moon. Tired, the other two, went to sleep on the shed&#x2019;s floor. I, on the other hand, could not take my eyes off the moon. I tried to take some pictures through my phone but it was not as clear as the actual image, which was at least 10 times more sharp and bright. The moon was so bright through the telescope that looking for a long time blinded your eye for a min. Therefore, I took a break and decided to see what was going on, on the other side of the thin sheet of a wall. I climbed up the ladder and peeked through the roof. To my surprise, I was not the only one awake, the deers were giving me company. No flashlight this time, since I was inside the shed; I could easily spot them under the moonlight. They were alerted by my movement but could not see me, so they did not run away this time. However, they kept looking in my direction and I, in theirs. I just stood there, on that ladder, for 15 mins looking at them, and making no sound, and they got back to their grazing. Another 15 mins, and I got back to my moon. I kept alternating between the deers and the moon. Around 3am, these deers got more than alerted, and a few of them started barking at me. It was scary in the beginning since I had no clue that deers could bark and that too, quite loudly. I stood still, staring at them. Then, from some corner, I could hear the wild boars roar, and another corner, a sound, I was completely clueless about. At that moment, I felt like I am one of them, the wild. I too wanted to make a sound but was scared and did not know what kind of sound to make. The three kinds of them, took turns to bark, roar and make a sound, I had no idea about. The deers, I could see but the other two, I could only hear. I just kept looking through the roof at the moonlit forest, spellbound and mesmerized. The owner had warned us that the scariest of all the wild animals here, are the wild elephants, even scarier than the tigers and the bears. It would take them less than a minute to destroy the whole observatory and kill us. Fortunately, I did not come across any elephants and soon the dawn was here. I woke them up and we retired to our rooms.This was one of the most extraordinary experiences I had so far, and the most mystical. All this detailed description, because I feel everyone should pursue amateur astronomy to some extent in his or her life. As the astronomer said, &#x201C;Astronomy is the oldest of all sciences, prevailing since prehistoric times, as witnessed proof in many cave paintings&#x201D;. Our ancestors gazed up to the stars more often than we do now. We have forgotten to look up at the sky and admire the wonders of the Universe. It is so unlike anything we see around us. So heavenly and magnificent, that it changes you as a person and your whole perspective towards life. It makes you more humble and happy, and one with the Universe.",

Korku tribal community refers to Tiger as their maternal uncle and not a beast from the cat family.The people of the tribe have their own medicinal systems, and their own names for biodiversity. Farmers there love the bond they share with Tigers and give it utmost respect.Melghat is also a center for medicinal plants and ayurveda lessoons. The tribal community is very humble and welcoming out here.

Started at 7 am and reached at 10.30 am.Day 1Explore the ancient and royal Jaipur in a go..JANTAR MANTAR - CITY PALACE - SISODIYA RANI BAGH - CHOKHI DHANIStarted with Jantar Mantar, the astronomical marvel, bought entry tickets for Rs.50 each being Indians and fought through the Jaipur heat to see the ancient instruments used to calculate time, months and year. There were instruments to position and study the planetary bodies as well. Such precision and scientific approach was awe inspiring. Though i couldnt comprehend it all in details, but felt proud of our ancenstors. City Palace, the abode of King of Jaipur was our next stop, being right infront of Jantar Mantar. Magnanimously built, adorned with intricate designs in the pink color of the Pink City. Here one gets to see the old adornments of the Royal family. Also one can feel the larger than life lifestyle the Royal family then enjoyed.Moving on we enjoyed our meal at Nibs Cafe.This cafe is way contemporary in the land of ancients. Above expectation, ambience and food were delightful.From here we quickly strolled through the Sisodiya Rani bagh, which Raja Jai Singh devloped for his &apos;Patrani&apos; for evening walk. Away from city&apos;s hustle bustle right infront of lush green Arvali range, the garden is well maintained for a peaceful nature walk.Now we moved ahead for our final destination of the day &apos;Chokhi Dhani&apos;, the place not to be missed, as it is the perfect amalgamation of great rajasthani culture. Right from cultural dances, songs, performances, shopping, story telling to unforgettable hospitality at the dinner area &apos;Khao Sa&apos;, this place is complete in itself, one can spend 2-3 hours here with so much to do around.Sisodiya Rani ka BaghNibs CafeNibs CafeChokhi DhaniChokhi Dhani traditional architectureHaldi ghati ki ladai mockup at Chokhi DhaniJohar practice, by Rani Padmini, mock up at Chokhi DhaniBanaras Ghat mockup in Chokhi DhaniRajasthani cuisine experienceSome Marwari, language of RajasthanJantar Mantar, time calculatorCity PalaceOne of the devices at Jantar Mantar Day 2SHOPPING - NAHARGARH FORTOur next day started with shopping! Bapu bazar, the market for everything in jaipur is where we indulged into street shopping for Kurtis, jutis and the churans. We also explored Sarogi Mansion for sarees. Ahh! Rajasthan has got such beautiful colors for clothes. One should definitely buy atleast one kota silk saree from here, it so lite and colorful.After our shopping spree we went to MI road for lassi at Lassiwala, unfortunately we were late and the lassi was over for the day at 3pm btw, who sells so fast?!&#xA0; anyways our craving was so strong we managed at shop next to it. After our lassi and hearty lunch at Grand Chanakya. We moved to Nahargarh Fort which took us an hour to reach from MI road. The moment we reached, the weather was happy on us and we could enjoy the beautiful views from the top. The fort is well maintained and&#xA0; the area around is huge like a colony. But the view of dense Jaipur city and surrounding Arvali range mountains is so meditative. As the fort was closed down by 5.30 pm, we had to leave and realising we wont be able to visit Amer palace, which made us sad, but being helpless we decided to stay back for a cup of coffee&#xA0; at the restaurant in the fort &quot;Once upon a time in Nahargarh&quot;. From here we enjoyed setting sun and saw changing shades of the fort. It was serene. This is how our day of exploration ended.FYI All forts and palaces close between 4.00 - 5.30 pm. Also all major shopping hubs remain closed on sundays. Plan accordingly.On our way to Nahargarh fort. Terrace of Nahargarh fortView from the terraceThe extending fort walls",

It&#x2019;s unique culture is a rich and chaotic blend of ancient traditions and modern lifestyle &#x2013; something that is depicted very clearly in one of its most iconic landmarks, Clarks Amer. The first five-star hotel to be set up in all of Rajasthan, Clarks Amer is situated in the heart of the city, just 10 minutes from the airport.

After a warm welcome with a tika ceremony, we were promptly escorted to our Penthouse on the eighth floor. With a duplex arrangement, a study area, luxurious bedroom, marble bathroom equipped with a bathtub, shower, and Kama Ayurveda toiletries, we knew that the next two days were going to be all about pampering, luxury and indulgence.Credits: Siddharth SujanCredits: Siddharth SujanCredits: Siddharth SujanCredits: Siddharth SujanThe hotel has eight occupied floors with 217 rooms divided into four types of accommodations &#x2013; Superior Rooms, Club rooms, Penthouses, and Presidential Suites.

If you&#x2019;re looking for rooms with a great view, opt for one of the penthouses, which are located on the highest floor and overlook not just the hotel lawns but also the city.Credits: Siddharth SujanCredits: Siddharth SujanClarks Amer boasts of being Rajasthan&#x2019;s first five-star property, set up over five decades ago when the concept was still nascent in India. Through the years, while Jaipur has changed drastically, the hotel has managed to retain its iconic status as well as preserve its charm. And while you will find all the aspects of a modern, luxurious stay here, you will also be surprised by the heartwarming hospitality and personalised touch &#x2013; which is the very essence of Rajasthani culture and often something that is difficult to find in corporate hotel chains.FacilitiesCredits: Siddharth SujanCredits: Siddharth SujanCredits: Siddharth SujanThe property is like an oasis in the middle of a desert, boasting of one of the greenest landscapes in the city, which is rapidly developing into a concrete jungle. It has two large lawns &#x2013; Rama Bagh and Semal Bagh (named after the Semal trees growing here), each with a capacity to house between 1,500 to 2,000 people.

The hotel also has several banquets and a 10,000 square feet pillar-less hall equipped to host an event of any scale.The rooms, as I mentioned above, are fully equipped with all modern amenities &#x2013; television, seating area, study, modern bathrooms, and WiFi.

It is a completely chef-operated, 24-hour cafe that produces some of the best pizzas and bakes in all of Jaipur. What this means is that everything at the restaurant is handled by chefs &#x2013; everything from preparing food to serving and cleaning the dishes. They even grow their own produce!Located on the ground floor of the hotel, Zolocrust offers a choice of delectable sandwiches, soups, salads, cakes, pastries, and shakes. All of the bakery items for the entire hotel are prepared here, including all breads, muffins, and cakes. The restaurant recycles almost 80 per cent of its waste to create compost.

They do have their own heritage tours covering several monuments and markets, however, if you want something more personalised, you can definitely get in touch with them.Credits: Siddharth SujanInitiativesWhat impressed me most about Clarks Amer is the initiatives that have been taken by the hotel to become more environmentally conscious and to give back to society. The hotel not just has one of the greenest covers in all of Jaipur, but has also started work on reducing use of plastic. They&#x2019;ve switched to paper straws and cutlery and are working on opening a bottling plant within the hotel to do away with plastic water bottles and replace them with glass ones. Not just that, the hotel also ensures that the food waste created is not thrown but is used instead to create compost.In an attempt to reduce its carbon footprint, Clarks Amer has started Seeds of Change campaign where they&#x2019;re planning a tree-plantation drive in Jaipur to plant 10,000 trees. Besides this, they also support an NGO called Help In Suffering which helps injured animals and those in distress by rehabilitating them and finding them more loving homes.  \tHow to get thereBy air: Taking a flight to Jaipur International Airport is the best way to reach Clarks Amer. The property is just a short 10-minute drive from the airport and the staff can arrange a pick-up and drop for you from there.By train: Jaipur Junction is the major railway station which is extremely well connected to the rest of the country. It serves as the headquarters of the Northwestern Railway Zone and is also a pitstop for the famous luxurious train &#x2013; Palace on Wheels. Clarks Amer is located at a distance of about 10km from Jaipur Junction and takes around 25 minutes to reach.By road: Jaipur has a well-connected network of roads. The major national highways connecting it to other cities are NH 48, NH 11 and NH 12. If you&#x2019;re in the mood for some adventure, a road trip to Jaipur is a great idea. If you&apos;re coming from Delhi, Jaipur is just a 5-hour journey. Once you enter the city from NH48, it takes about 35-40 minutes to reach the hotel depending on the traffic conditions.A stay at Clarks Amer will help you revel in the lap of luxury, culture, and history.

		"Text": "Ideal Ayurvedic ResortBeing a Keralite itself, it was awkward to say that this is my first trip to the capital of the state. Trivandrum is a relatively compact but energetic city and a nice prologue to urban life down south. But My journey was not to explore trivandrum , my journey was to one of the peaceful ayurvedic resort in Kerala - Ideal Ayurvedic Resort. Ideal Ayurvedic ResortI have heard about this resort so many times, through my friends, social media etc. My journey was in search of peace of mind. And i didn&apos;t find any better place than this to get some piece of mind.\nIdeal Ayurvedic ResortHotelsMapI choose Volvo Bus for my travel to Trivandrum. The Travel started at the time of 7 in the evening and it took about 5 hours to reach in Trivandrum. I must say that traveling in night is beyond words to explain. I literally enjoyed the travel and i didn&apos;t even felt that it took about five hours to reach over there.Kovalam to ChowaraThe manager of the resort took me to the resort in his car. Ideal ayurvedic resort is situated in Chowara which is about 8 km from kovalam. Chowara is a small village, and it is amazing to to find a place like this amidst the crowded city like Kovalam, Trivandrum. On my way to the resort I found that this place is surrounded by number of resorts than number of people live over there (LoL).By watching the resorts you may felt like the place may be crowded or noisy, but it is not.

The guest house contain 10 beautifully decorated double bed rooms with modern amenities . The rooms also come with balcony that overlooks the pool. The cottages are embellished in traditional kerala architecture that further enhances the stay at the resort.I prefer a pool view room for my stay. I must say that the hospitality at the resort are beyond my words, Excellent staff, they will take care of every single thing while your stay at the resort. Even at the time of 11:30 PM they provide me very fresh dinner which was a treat to my taste buds.Ideal Ayurvedic ResortDay 2In the Morning i woke up to the stunning view of Pool. It was a the perfect view to start the day. I really enjoy my balcony from where you can see the entire surrounding of the resort. For the breakfast you need to go to the restaurant with in the resort.Ideal Ayurvedic ResortDiningThe restaurant within the resort offers a wide variety of dishes from authentic kerala cuisines to Chinese, European and Italian cuisines.

People undergoing treatments in the resort, will be served with foods according to the diet prescribed by the doctors to get better results in treatments and therapies.Nearby AttractionsThen I took a walk to the chowara beach which is only about 2 min away from the resort. The beach was not at all crowded, I enjoyed playing with waves in the resort, you can also get some snacks from nearby shops while enjoying the sea breeze.Ideal Ayurvedic ResortAyurvedic TreatmentsBeing the leaders among the best ayurvedic resorts in Kerala, Ideal Ayurvedic Resort offers a wide variety of ayurvedic programms. The resort believes that for the well being of an individual there should be a perfect balance between the mind, body and soul.According to their rule, a person should consult the doctor with in the resort before undergoing any ayurvedic procedure. The resort consist of 22+ therapists and doctors in both gender. I consult one of the doctor over there and he prescribed me to took Shirodhara Treatment.The ayurvedic herbs and medicines for the ayurvedic programms are used from the pharmacy within the resort. They will provide specific clothes to wear to get prepared by the treatment. The Shirodhara treatment is mainly recommended for people having stress and anxiety. They have specific rooms of every type of treatments you prefer. The shirodhara treatment will give you very cooling effect that will automatically leads to peace of mind. I feel very refreshed after the treatment and i felt like more energy have come to my body and mind After the treatment.Ideal Ayurvedic ResortAfter the treatment they took me to the restaurant and served a plate full of fruits, which was fresh and delicious.

It is so beautiful, you will never take out your eyes from the scenario.Ideal Ayurvedic ResortSince I have booked the return volvo to my place in the night, I said good bye to one of the finest resorts in kerala.

		"Text": "It is 12 in the afternoon. I have just left for Chalakudy after enjoying the gorgeous might of Athirapilly Waterfalls. The river is flooding after it has rained and so the force of waterfall has increased tenfold. As I get in the returning bus and reach the network area, my friend Divya who left her city life to start a small homestay on the backwaters of a village in Alleppey messages me. She tells me that the Nehru Trophy Boat Race, the reason because of which I have come to Kerala, has been postponed. August is the most important month in Kerala. This time marks the beginning of Onam. The 10 days of festive spirit starts with the energetic Nehru Trophy Boat Race in the backwaters of Alleppey. This is followed by a few smaller events here and there. Among these, the most important event is Athachamayam Thrippunithura in Ernakulam. This year, travelling to Kerala in August is significant because the rare Neelkurinji has bloomed after 12 years. It was being expected that the number of tourists coming to Kerala in these 10 days will be very high. But now I am one of the few lakh tourists who had come to Alleppey just to see the grand boat race. People with huge cameras with kilometre long lenses can be seen in every nook and corner. They are now walking and ranting as if the floods are the festival&#x2019;s fault. At-least, I didn&#x2019;t purchase the stadium tickets since I was planning to see the race from a more local territory. Wonder how Kerala tourism will manage this.Nature is unpredictable. Doesn&#x2019;t matter how peak the human intelligence reaches, the uncertainty of such natural events can never be guessed. After weeks of lull, it started raining all of a sudden and the gates of Iddukki Dam had to be opened. The danger of flood increased and all the activity around the backwaters and Periyar River had to be shut down. Munnar, the place where Neelkurinji is supposed to bloom, has been affected by the rains and it has slowed down the blooming speed of the flowers. Predicted to be seen by 15th of August, there is no guarantee of flower sightings. As of now, all the flights from Cochin have been diverted. If you are travelling in or out of Cochin in this week then better check with your airlines and confirm that you are arriving in Kochi and not in Calicut or Trivendrum. Although the problem is expected to be resolved in the next 24 hours. Apart from Kerala, the danger of flood in Coorg and the regions near Cauvery belt has increased too. Travelling is not advised because of rainfalls and landslides. After speaking to many visitors in Alleppey, I figured out that no one wants to take risk to see the Neelkurinji blooming while it rains this badly. The toll on life and property due to this has only increased since the news started coming out. Hope things get in order by the time Onam festival arrives. If you are visiting Kerala in the coming week then make sure that you confirm about the flood situation in your area. Trains are being delayed and flights diverted, so re-check the schedules before starting your journey. As of now Idukki, Wayanad and areas of Malabar are under severe threat of flood and rains. It will be a better idea to postpone your trip for a few days.How can I help?Though travelling to Kerala is out of bounds, that in no way means that we overlook the situation in the state. The people of Kerala are in dire need of any kind of help and here&apos;s how you can do your bit:1. Chief Minister Disaster Relief Fund (CMDRF)\t  \tKerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan has set up a relief fund, seeking financial aid for those affected in different parts of the state.

Rapid Response&apos;s Food and Medical CampsThe team behind Rapid Response, one of the most recognised NGOs working in the region has been on ground ever since tragedy struck in Kerala.

You can send in your donations at District Collector Idukki, Collectorate, Painavu PO, Kuyilimala, Idukki-685603.The district administration in Ernakulam has tied up with an NGO, Anbodu Kochi who is now carrying out rescue operations in the district. Anbodu Kochi has several collection centres in Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Follow them on their Facebook page to know the requirements and drop the objects at their collection centres. The people of Kerala need our help more than ever before and it&apos;s time we step up and lend a helping hand. Spread the word and motivate your friends, family and colleagues to act and help out the millions in suffering.",

		"Text": "Travel is the new cool. Either everyone is doing it or is dreaming of it. But, in the pursuit of this new cool we are ignoring many different facets of traveling and only focusing on the cooler aspects. I am a long term traveller and I travelled continuously for 2.5 years. I visited some 14 countries of Latin America and 10 Indian states. The reactions and questions I usually get are the following: &quot;Wow, that is so adventurous&quot;, &quot;that&apos;s so cool&quot;, &quot;how many countries?&quot;, &quot;where next?&quot; etc.What no one asks or thinks about is the internal struggle that I go through to explore and understand our planet. We are wired to live a stable life in familiar surroundings. Wake up in new cities, memorise the streets, find food, introduce yourself and make friends. It is taxing on the mind and the body. And, it is not always easy to find the company you seek. Life on the road can be dark and lonely. In my 2.5 years on the road, I parsed four continents and many a times I felt like giving up and going home. But at the opportune, I met someone who made me feel like home in those faraway lands.Three weeks, two failed visas and one love story \nEcuadorHotelsMapIt was my second week in Quito and I went to the Colombian consulate to apply for a Colombian tourist visa. The counsellor asked me to submit a letter to her stating why I want to visit Colombia in Spanish. My eyes popped out. I barely knew any Spanish at that time. Her secretary came to my rescue. She said something in Spanish and asked me to follow her. We went to a nearby cyber cafe and she typed the letter for me. I was moved.I nervously held my phone in left hand as Google duly translated, &quot;&#xBF;Te gustar&#xED;a ir conmigo a tomar un caf&#xE9;, una cerveza o cenar?&quot; (Would you like to go for a coffee, beer or dinner with me?)She smiled, &quot;Si&quot;.What followed was a three week long relationship/fling. She spoke no English and I spoke very little Spanish. Yet, the language barrier never stopped us from having meaningful conversations. One thing that she said stuck me and I faced it a couple of years later in India. This is what she said, &quot;Colombia will never be able to recover from the byproducts of the narco business. The lives and money we are losing is here and now. But, it is the future that I am worried about. Boys aged six and above are involved in narco trafficking. The youth of Colombia is skipping school to earn quick bucks. They are not trained for anything else. So, what will happen to them when the narco business collapses? They will be lost with no ray of hope.&quot;Two years later, I saw kids skipping school and selling hash in the tiny Himalayan hamlet of Malana. They proudly said, &quot;Education is such a slow way of earning money. We want the money here and now.&quot;Love and a month&apos;s rentCubaHotelsMap  \tOn my second day in Cuba, I visited 331 Art Space, an art gallery where Havana&apos;s artists and art lovers gather. I was examining an artwork just when a girl asked me, &quot;Where are you from?&quot;. We spoke for a good half an hour and agreed to meet the next day. We walked on the Malecon hand-in-hand with the salty breeze embracing us. We sat on the rocky shore of the sea talking about my travels, growing up in Cuba and her pursuit of becoming a doctor. After the ocean, it was time to drink some poison.After the third glass of Havana Club, she asked, &quot;Can you give me $40?&quot;&quot;Sorry,&quot; I was taken aback.&quot;I need to pay my rent and I have no money,&quot; she explained.&quot;Sorry, but I cannot just give you $40,&quot; I said.&quot;Varun, you are a very nice guy. I had a great time with you up until now. But, I really need the money and I will have to find someone who could pay me for the night. I hope you understand. Here is my number and email. I&apos;d love to meet you again. Stay in touch.&quot;Love is a refuge when times are toughSerbiaHotelsMapSerbia is a country full of surprises. It is nothing that you expect it to be. Someone told me about the Afghan and Syrian refugees living in a park in Belgrade. I visited the park the very same afternoon. I saw a whole host of refugees from Afghanistan, Syria, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Some were praying, others chatting while a few were sleeping under the trees. I approached one of the girls with a badge to learn more about the situation.She brought me to speed regarding the refugee situation. I gave her some ideas on how the refugees can be helped. We talked till sundown and beyond. We had a great time. She took me to her favourite places over the next few days. We sat with our feet in the Danube, prayed at St. Sava Church, visited war ruins and ate and drank till our hearts were filled with content. Seeing Serbia from her perspective made me fall in love with Serbia and her.On my last night in Belgrade, we were sleeping under a starry sky as she told me, &quot;Varun, we Serbians are seen as the villains of the Yugoslav War. Yes, to a larger extent it was our fault. But, all of us aren&apos;t necessarily bad people. Today, when rest of Europe is turning its back on these refugees, we are welcoming them with open arms. We Serbians have suffered a lot at the hands of Romans, Slavs, Byzantines, Bulgarians, Austro-Hungarians and the the Ottoman Turks. We had to flee their atrocities and find refuge elsewhere which is why we can empathize with the refugees. I want you to go out and tell your fellow countrymen that they are all welcome in Serbia.&quot;I kissed her and promised that I will come back to Serbia. Very soon hopefully.Finding affection in the Naxal Red CorridorBastarHotelsMap  \tI got on a train from Araku Valley to Jagdalpur, the heart of Bastar. In all honesty, I had never thought about Chhattisgarh with any consciousness. It was an impromptu idea. And, Bastar took me by surprise. Extremely friendly people, rich tribal culture, virgin nature, colourful markets and eclectic food. I contacted Unexplored Bastar to learn more about Baster. I spoke with their writer. We hit it off instantly. She was Bastar in a nutshell - simple, happy and full of life.She told me, &quot;We in Bastar are not as smart as people in other parts of India. We are simple and content people. Still, Bastar and Chhattisgarh in general has a very negative image all across India. People think they will get kidnapped by Naxalites if they visit Bastar. But, I guarantee you Bastar is safer than Delhi or Bombay. I can even take you to a Naxal camp and they will welcome you with open arms. They have nothing against tourists. Their fight is against the government and the companies hell bent on ruining our pristine nature and simple lifestyle. You can travel through the length and breadth of Bastar and I guarantee you that you will never go hungry or sleep without a roof even if you are penniless.&quot;I looked at the innocence in her eyes. Amidst never ending roads, long lonely nights and the emptiness, it is the shining light of such eyes that keeps me going. Far away from friends, family and familiar faces, it is the hope of encountering love at the next corner, milestone or coffee shop that keeps me going.You too have a similar story to tell?

Churna Tiger Reserve is a zone of Satpura National Park. Located 180km from Bhopal, can be reached via Itarsi or Bhopal and also by booking the safari from Madhai Gate and Pachmari gate. Booking of the Rest House and safari is to be done through the Hoshangabad Office of MP Forest Dept. You don&#x2019;t get safari jeep from Churna gate, you have to bring off road vehicle for safari.Satpura Tiger ReserveHotelsMapWe started in noon with scorching sun overhead, it was damn hot on the way but once you enter the core area it was better. British built the rest house, it has big rooms with high rise terrace. The place runs on solar electricity and there is no internet within 50km. After settling down we headed to our first safari, up and down the hills we can see deer, wild boars and buffalo.ChurnaHotelsMapThe sun was setting down and so the temperature. We marked some constellations in the clear night sky. The moon and the array of stars was littering the sky and earth. We could hear animals howling far off, it was quiet all around. The night gets colder and colder and finally we have to cover ourselves with the heavy quilts, in noon we were wandering over the use of them in summer but now we realized their importance. We were just 50km off the highway and who can imagine such drastic change in weather and environment.Morning 5.30am we took another safari; the weather was still chill and moist. The sun was sparkling on top of the dewdrops. It was not all green around with many dry and brown patches but Palash trees filled it with bright orange color. It was a perfect place for a vacation away from the pollution, phones and mails, you tend to spend more time with the people rather than on social media.Check out full blog on https://espirituelibre.blogspot.com/2018/08/star-gazing-inside-core-jungle-churna.html",

		"Text": "Manifestation of Goddess Parvati, Nanda Devi, stands at 7816 metres in the Greater Himalayas. It is the second highest peak in India and is considered the patron Goddess of Uttarakhand, thus holds much religious significance in its own right, and is also the consort of Lord Shiva. The peak and surrounding mountains have been closed for, both, locals and foreign climbers owing to its religious significance and for the protection of it&apos;s fragile ecosystem. But is that all? History says other wise. What looks like the script of a James Bond inspired high-voltage drama, has been the greatest mountaineering-cum-espionage operation of the 20th century. And It&apos;s stage was the mighty Himalayas, more precisely the Nanda Devi peak. \t  \tThe plan.From 1965 through 1968, the CIA collaborated with the Indian Intelligence Bureau (of course, with full co operation of the Indian government) to train some of the most elite climbers to install a nuclear-powered sensing device on the Nanda Peak. This would eavesdrop on China&#x2019;s burgeoning nuclear ambitions that were being worked upon in full force in the neighbouring Xinjiang province. The device.The plan was to intercept radio telemetry signals from the Chinese ground control through a transceiver, which would then transfer this information to the CIA station. This transceiver was powered by a System for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) turning radioactive heat into electricity. The battery was made of a Plutonium alloy, radioactive in nature, with expected longetivity of more than a century. This device weighed more than 50 kg and is said to be half the size of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The avalanche.When the expedition team was about to reach the summit, the weather worsened, an avalanche was predicted. The expedition leader Manmohan Singh Kohli had the option to save either the men or the machine. He decided to save the men. And thus, the Plutonium laden device got pulverised in the avalanche, and is said to be slowly making its way towards the headwaters of the Ganges ever since. The actions taken. Kohli anticipated large scale contamination of the river, affecting lives of people living as far as in Kolkata. Fearing this, in the year 1966 the team went back to the majestic mountain to retrieve the device, only to return empty handed. The waters of Rishi Ganga (the river that drains the Nanda Devi glacier into the Ganges) and Ganges were tested multiple times for radiation and contamination but nothing was found. The subsequent year.In the year 1968, the Indo-American spy team successfully installed another device on the shoulder of the adjoining peak, Sunanda Devi. After repeated blizzards and snowstorms, the device got submerged in snow, only to be retrieved two months later with absolutely no intel, thus, rendering the entire mission futile. \t  \tThe status of Nanda Devi now.Owing to the activities of the CIA, the Nanda Devi peak and its surrounding areas were closed for foreign expeditions. It opened in the year 1974, only to be closed again from 1983. In the year 1988, Nanda Devi National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, &quot;of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humankind.&quot;Currently, the entire sanctuary (including the summit) remains closed for expeditions and treks, for both locals and foreign climbers. Having said that Sunanda Devi (previously known as Nanda Devi East) remains open from the east side, leading to the standard south ridge route.Nanda Devi owes her charm not only to her height or setting, but also to the fact that in the midst of these icy flanks lies a terrifying vestige of Cold War&apos;s most daring adventure, a vestige that could threaten the lives of millions.Do you have any such spooky travel story in mind?

With quaint cafes, independent designers and bookstores, and an underground music and art scene, Berlin could be a creative&#x2019;s paradise. During my 3-month solo stay in Berlin, I stayed in four different neighbourhoods meeting different people each time, exploring subcultures that co-existed. Soon I knew that the main themes for my journey were going to be exploring the coffee cultures and a newly cultivated art scene in Berlin with the growing cross culture communities from Syria, Palestine and other eastern cultures. I knew I needed to really engage in the community to get a real taste of the city, hence I decided to work out of a conscious co-working space in Mitte ( centre of the city) and also worked for a Foundation that supported education in Morocco by selling artisanal products. During my stay, I attended the Berlin art week which is an art festival that takes place every September with many independent art galleries as well as some popular ones like Sammlung Boros and me collectors room.In a week&#x2019;s time, I had met a lot of creative seekers, all engaged in the community in alternate ways. During these working days, I had a chance to meet artists who were part of a collective called &#x2018;A Journey of belonging&#x2019; an open studio initiative at Bikini Berlin. Their work spoke of the experience of war and crisis they had experienced in their native homes and it influenced my experience too as an artist to express all that noise inside with such grace. Jeanno and Ahmed particularly made an impact on me. Jeanno used textiles as a material memory to speak of her times in Afghanistan. She explored the ritual of hair braiding in Afghanistan and that special intimate moment&apos;s young girls share with their mothers. Ahmed used broken glass with hints of charcoal and blues to express his experience during the Syrian war. I guess all pain does lead to creativity, some thoughts I had on the way back on U-Bahn. With art on the underground, spending more than an hour every day on the Ubahn kept me inspired. U Bahn had some conic tiled stations, I noticed. I read somewhere, &#x2018;What canals are to Amsterdam, street art is to Berlin&#x2019;. One can see that Berlin&#x2019;s political history and the suffering has definitely led to a lot of creativity.I started living in Berlin in the first week of September, and in a month winter had hit and fallen leaves that made the city gold and mustard now had turned grey. I was going to be in Germany during Christmas and I was already planning a getaway. Berlin which is well connected with most cities in Germany was only 2 hours train ride to Hamburg. I had made a list of must do in the city covering Kunsthalle Hamburg, Speicherstadt and Harbour cube, Trostbr&#xFC;cke, Beatles Platz and Town Hall, St Pauli Elbtunnel, St. Michael&#x2019;s church, Elbe Philharmonic Hall and Alsterarkaden, but most time was gone at the Christmas markets eating sausages and mulled wine! Well, no place can be completely experienced without its food and Berlin has a lot to offer and could I call Berlin the cafe capital of Europe? Almost! The German capital is a lot more than Pretzels and currywurst, a stereotype about Germany ( Although I absolutely love them) From its famous brunches and vegan options to commonly found Vietnamese. Also, Did you know Doner kebab was founded in Berlin?! Berlin also has some great street markets that one could explore for food or vintage finds on both weekdays and weekends. The one on Hackescher market on Saturdays had my favourite avocado hummus! Markthalle Neun is where I would go for local produce and Flohmarkt mauerpark had its last few weeks left before it would close for winters.Here is a curated guide to some of my favourites:Cafe guide to Berlin1.

		"Text": "Being conscious means being aware and consciously choosing elements in your life that are nourishing for the soul. It becomes important to have this for a sense of control as well as for a sense of being a flow, a sense of trust in nature. Personal and spiritual growth is a journey that lasts throughout our lives, but travelling can expose us to the opportunity to fasten some learning. Almost like going to the next level of a video game. You gain certain skills, life tools that help us move forward in this journey. Last few years of travelling has led to many journeys outside of my hometown Delhi and inward journeys too. A journey of understanding my self better, developing a more conscious me and adopting a few habits while travelling that I feel have led to personal growth.Here are some key things that I always keep in mind while travelling that has made it more spiritual:Experience LocalTake the public transport, Talk to the local people, Smile at them. Learn a few words and phrases of the local language to connect with them better. The biggest inspiration to travel is to experience out of the ordinary everyday life to understand a different perspective and culture. Educate yourself about other ways of developing and understanding life. When I visited South India last year, I realised that people had a simpler life compared to people in north India. Small efforts like walking to the vegetable market instead of a motor vehicle is a very common thing in south India no matter what strata of the society you belong to. Picking up certain habits from other cultures, even small food habits helps in personal growth as it&apos;s a conscious decision you make for a life better. The friends I make while travelling, I make a point to keep in touch. I like the cosmopolitan approach to life where I feel like I am a global nomad with not a restricted cultural identity. The connection between travelling and understanding the local ways helps us shed the cultural boundaries thus bringing us closer. One learns to let go of judgements when learns to accept differences in cultures.Eat LocalWhen travelling, I always go grocery shopping and cook a meal for myself? An exercise to indulge all my senses. engaging in an activity bring us to focus on the present. Like an old India saying: &apos; What makes the man is the food he eats &apos;, hence, to understand a culture, food is a big component. Shopping for local vegetables, fruits, bread and dairy makes me happy. Sit next to a window in a cafe and sip a local tea or coffee. Do it every day of travel. Sitting in a cafe looking out of a window I notice small things, the routine things of the local people. After many years of visiting a place, I don&apos;t really remember the details of certain things but I do remember the vibe of the place, and this is a great opportunity to connect to a place.WalkBe close to nature, take walks. If you are an adventure traveller or a city tourist, either way, there is no better way to explore. Hike, Enjoy the rain, Sit in a park, Watch a flowing river or Listen to hustling trees. Nature has all the answers we need. Usually, my trips are a combination of different landscapes with always a city and some countryside.DocumentCarry a journal and pen down all that you feel. From little details to lists, write them all down. Take pictures, not just of yourself but of the city. Be curious, I usually give my self a creative project when travelling. It increases my power to observe. During my travels in Italy, I tried to capture the various doors and windows of Venice, Milan and Verona. It was a creative burst almost when I went around looking for details, colours, textures. It increases my excitement of the travel as well as gave me a tangible memory. Collect mementoes. Shop local, bring small things that remind you of small moments or of a place. I always bring a leaf. flower, a book and a journal from everywhere I go.Take A Learning HolidayEngage in arts, literature, language, music, dance. I recently took a pottery vacay in Himachal Pradesh, India and last year learnt to tie and dye in Jaipur. I feel touch has a lot to do with therapy. Pottery clay is earth, an element of nature, being close to that for a long period focusing all senses to creating something, makes us forget all that our mind holds. It teaches a lot of the way nature works, the creation and recreation, the forms that we can give that our in our control. even the need to talk becomes less. A similar experience happened when I visited the Osho meditation centre in Pune. Even though I attended a day&apos;s program, I learnt about dance meditation, a simple activity that brings us to the present and somehow the experience teaches us to be in a flow. A new skill helps us focus and gives us the power to create.Go Tech FreeEven though travelling nowadays means using apps on your phone all the time, I think practising silence a couple of times in a day to reflect, introspect can really help growth. Listen more. Read. I usually am reading 4-5 books at one time. All of the different subjects keep me curious. Awareness with all senses involved is sort of meditation. I remember a day before going to Pondicherry, my smartphone stopped working. I transferred my sim card to a 90&apos;s Nokia phone which only allowed a text message. Initially, I was a bit worried about not having all my contacts. emails handy, but I have to say after the 3-day trip I felt cleansed. I realised that the very important calls could still be made, and I was letting go of all the extra digital information that subconsciously I was always taking in, thus cluttering my mind. This constant need to check my phone went after a day which let me enjoy the present moment so much more. I actually documented all my notes in a journal rather than an app.Be AnonymousSitting in a cafe once in San Francisco I met up with someone who was curious to know what I was drawing in my journal. I told him I was an artist who was travelling solo. We got talking, never really exchanged any personal information. I realised while talking to him I was being who I wanted to be. It put me in a position with no baggage to behave like a certain someone. I realised I was being more of a person who I aspired to be that the person who I thought I was. This exercise made me realise that I could be whoever I wanted to be with the change in perception. I was saying and doing things that I wanted to do and a sudden shift in confidence was apparent which is motivating for oneself to be more of that. When one is with a familiar set of people, subconsciously we have similar actions and reactions, leading to similar results and self-image. In a new surrounding, meeting someone new who knows nothing about me, gave me a chance to be an improved version of myself. That shift only came because of this encounter. Usually, with a friend, I would not introduce myself as an artist but a consultant which is my day job. But I felt more confident of calling myself an artist with more possibility of acceptance in some way. This was a conscious moment for me as I realised I resonate more with the new self than the old one. Hence a great exercise to know yourself.Be SpontaneousI usually plan about 50% of my travels and always leave room for things that I might want to do impromptu. A road trip to LA from SF and a train journey from Paris to Brussels were some of the recent spontaneous things I did while travelling. It increases self-confidence and trust in oneself and life that one has surprises waiting without any fears of going wrong as well as having an explorer&apos;s attitude that if plan A doesn&apos;t work, one has a plan B while having the attitude of moving with the flow. I think this attitude is true to everything in life and not just travelling. Travelling becomes a teacher and an exam as well, but trusting life and moving forward is a skill that one can have anywhere and it has helped me as a person reducing anxiety and fear.Dress ComfortablyIn summers I usually wear linens and cotton and avoid all kind of synthetic materials. Usually a comfortable pair of slippers( Birkenstocks) as handy. For winters, my layered big jacket with some shawls and uggs. I try to pack light and avoid over accessorising. Key is being comfortable and confident in your skin without having the trouble to follow a fashion trend. I see that how we dress, the colours, materials have a direct effect on how we feel, hence dressing for the weather and for the activities helps us focus on the experience. An explorers attitude has a lot to do with the attire/ the uniform of the explorer!Do NothingStretch, breathe and smile!Key Take AwayConnect - Disconnect, Attach - detach, escape - immerse, Be mindful and mindless, Belong and Be a Nomad!Words and photos by Sayali Goyal.",

But as the saying goes, third time&#x2019;s the charm when I travelled with my friends. \nPalolem BeachHotelsMapI had the best time at this lesser known beach called Palolem Beach which is situated approximately 90 kms away from the main city; so technically it isn&#x2019;t completely Goa. We stumbled upon it by accident online and booked it without knowing anything about it. Let me jot down the highlight points of our trip so that anyone who wishes to have a serene experience in Goa can consult this!Palolem and Its beauty1. Road Trip to GoaWe drove overnight from Mysore to Goa on a pleasantly chilly December night. We preferred early December as it gets really crowded near the new years&#x2019;. Palolem comes way before the main city so it became nearer to us.2. The OceanI mean DUH! The shoreline is devoid of rocks and the sand is a soft shingly white which makes it quite a pleasant experience to take a dip in the ocean. The authorities there are strict about the garbage disposal so you&#x2019;ll not find bottles and other unpleasant articles strewn about.3. Shopping &amp; PartiesThe beach is secured on both ends with arches. Outside the beach, you&#x2019;ll find many small shops which sell trinkets, clothes, perfumes etc. Bargain well and you&#x2019;ll find yourself a good deal and a lot of souvenirs.We also came across an &#x2018;headphone party&#x2019; where each individual is given his own choice of music in his headphones and the party is pretty much silent on the outside.4.\tBoating &amp; KayakingThe boating and kayaking experience there is best enjoyed in the mornings. The boating covers three other beaches &#x2013; Butterfly beach and Paradise beach. You can disembark and play there for a bit and also catch glimpses of dolphins if you get lucky. I didn&#x2019;t get a chance to kayak but I&#x2019;m sure it must be an enthralling experience too.5.\tPhotographsLet me not shy away from confessing that I love being clicked. And that&#x2019;s exactly what I did in Goa &#x2013; click loads of pictures against the soft morning sun and clear blue waters. Make sure you carry the right sorta clothes, accessories et al and you&#x2019;ll find your gallery brimming with photos that you can upload on Instagram.POINT TO NOTE:We didn&#x2019;t wish to indulge in the hustle-bustle of the city so we stayed away from it. Keep sufficient time on your hands and a means of transport if you wish to travel to the main city.",

Everyone excited boarded the bus, and we left the city in the morning post an early breakfast. With many bathroom stops and also emergency stops once we entered the Ghaat Area, slowed us down a little. Yet we managed to reach Gokarna by Dinner Time. We stayed at a simple yet homely resort &quot; Kawari Resort&quot; 1 km away from the main Gokarna Beach.Day 2YanaHotelsMapThe next day, we got up early and fresh and ready for a Trek. We headed towards Yana which is about 2 - 2.5 hours from Gokarna. Yana holds on of the largest standing Rock Caves, where in you can walk through, go into the jungle and walk down again. It is a easy level trek, with loads of fun. Also there is a small river flowing through where you can play around a little bit and click breath taking pictures. We had packed up our lunch in small containers and post trek we had our lunch in amidst of the forest&apos;s timeless beauty.Post lunch, we returned back to our resort, changed and refreshed and headed towards the well known Om Beach. At one end of the beach there is &quot; Namaste Cafe&quot; and at the other end there is &quot; Nirvana Cafe&quot;. Both the cafes are opened from 12pm to 4pm and again they open at 7pm. The beach is peaceful and really beautiful.we ended up spending time there the whole afternoon till it was about to get a little dark. Also there were little showers due to which the experience at the beach was magical.Day 3BangaloreHotelsMapThe final day, post breakfast, we paid a visit to the temple, spent a little time on the main beach and headed back towards Bangalore. On the way we took a halt at Jog Falls for lunch. Co - incidentally, at that very moment for a few seconds all the clouds had cleared up and we could see the falls.Overall it was a remarkable road trip, with loads of adventure and loads of fun.Tips# Carry food everywhere, there are very few restaurants on the way.# Raincoat, and good shoes are must haves.# First aid kit with the basic medicines is a necessity since you would be traveling in the ghat section.# The weather would be very humid, so carry at least 3 extra tops or T shirts since you would end up taking bath at least thrice a day.# And Most importantly have fun on the trip, keep your phone aside, since rarely you will get network there!",

One might ask you - are you crazy? Would you be able to get the view of Kanchenjunga? Yes, it&apos;s true. If you are going to Darjeeling in Monsoon, there is hardly any chance that you would have a glance of Kanchenjunga and other Himalayan peaks due to misty and foggy weather. And how is Darjeeling without them? Less attractive! And to add to the misery, there are also landslides during Monsoon which may cut off some road routes. Then why should anyone go to Darjeeling in Monsoon? My answer in one line - to experience &apos;green&apos; Darjeeling.Darjeeling Station and Toy TrainHimalayan Peaks from Observatory HillSnowy Peak of KanchenjungaMahakal TempleMahakal TempleMahakal Templea Cave in Mahakal TempleRock GardenRock GardenRock GardenRock GardenRock GardenRock GardenRock GardenNature is at its best during this time. Monsoon usually arrives in Darjeeling in June and stretches till September. The temperature varies between 15&#xB0;C and 25&#xB0;C. During the rainy season, the lush green environment becomes greener making the town and its slopes and forests even more beautiful. The drops of rain create a romantic atmosphere. The sheer joy of a toy train ride in the rain through the breathtaking landscapes is unforgettable. You will enjoy the magical play of the fog. You can see the fog coming and covering the entire place with a white blanket and suddenly, in no time, it&apos;s all gone. Visibility of the place gets clear and unclear within minutes. You will see the springs and the waterfalls roaring in their full flow. There are more reasons for choosing this season. There are very few tourists. It makes the hill town so peaceful, tranquil and serene. The accommodations and cars for sightseeing are available at bargainable rates making your trip pocket friendly.

		"Text": "Summers phewwww!So y&apos;all might have already planned to watch Netflix and chill at home. But me and my sisters planned a little different than that idea.Tiger safari and chill!We had a good 3 days of holidaying at Pench Tiger Reserve.Exploring the surrounding forests, walking forest trails, a candle light dinner in the middle of the forest but a protected area, breakfast in the middle of the forest, sitting by the pool in the midnight,star gazing, burst of golden rays into the lavender sky while watching a sunset, birds chirping into a meditating music to wake you up in the morning, all this which left a remarkable memory for life.I came back with a satisfaction that I not just spotted adult Tigers but even two cubs who were the cherry on top for my amazing safari tripSo Here&#x2019;s a little information about Pench Reserve before I tell you how I planned my safari.Pench Tiger Reserve is spread over Seoni and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh and Nagpur district of Maharashtra.The need to protect the tigers in the terrain, led to the division of 449.39 sq. km of area as the Pench Wildlife Sanctuary and finally in 1983, it was declared a National Park and then a Tiger Reserve in 1992.There are three gates to the park, which are the Turia Gate, the Karmajhiri Gate and the Jamtara Gate out of which Turia Gate is the most popular. This reserve is famously known as &#x2018;Mowgli&#x2019;s Land&#x2019;.I always had a thought that Nagpur was only for oranges But Pench&#x2019;s flora and fauna surprises you with it&#x2019;s beauty.The forest not only Includes tigers and leopards which are on top of the food chain, but there are about thirty nine species of mammals found here.The mega mammals are Gaur, Sambhar, Spotted deers, Nilgai, Barking deer, Indian Gazelle, Sloth bear, wild dogs, langurs, rhesus macaques etc.The forest wasn&#x2019;t affected by summers much, infact looked beautiful everywhere around with dense trees or open field at the same time.I wonder how winters in Pench would look like?So let&#x2019;s get to the plan I followedHow did I reach here?We took a train from Mumbai around 8:30 that reached Nagpur station in the morning. From Nagpur station, seoni, where our resort was booked was about 3-4 hours. One can also travel by Flight or by Road. But I feel, train would be very convenient if taken a night journey.Where did I stay?My stay was at Pench Jungle Camp Resort. I would give a very good rating for this one. From hospitality to quality time, everything was served well. They have very good gestures to make their guests happy.From Luxury resorts to budget resorts, Pench has a lot to offer to every kind of traveller.How to book safari tickets and permission?Jungle Safari has its own pleasure. The safari tickets can be booked online through the website: mponline.gov.in. You can also book the tickets through the resort in which you have decided to stay.My tickets for all the four safaris were already booked in my package.The best time to visit Pench would be in winters, but summers , only if you are able to tolerate the heat, there could be a lot of chances to spot wild animals more.I&#x2019;m providing the contact details below which might help you to plan this trip.Things will fall into place in an easy way if you book through this agent.He goes out of the box to help and keeps your convenience with great safari experiences to hold on for life.This is the link for the contact details.https://www.facebook.com/SafariandCultureIndia/Tips:1. Book for atleast 4 safaris in your plan, so you get more chances to spot the wild!2. Be calm, stay patient and alert throughout the time you&#x2019;re in the Jeep, while the safari.3. Don&#x2019;t go against forest rules.4. Spend less money on travel.5. Communicate with your safari guideto know territories of tigers belongingand take up a brief history of the stories happened in the forest.Sounds exciting?? I hope I come to a great help to you!C&#x2019;mon wait no more and plan a winter safari right now????Follow my instagram page :https://www.instagram.com/the_greedy_nomad",

		"Text": "kalsubai Treking And CampingHotelsMapKalsubai is a mountain in the Western Ghats, located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Its summit situated at an elevation of 1646 metres (5400 feet) is the highest point in Maharashtra which earns it the much glorified title of the &apos;Everest of Maharashtra&apos;The mountain can be viewed, in its entirety, from Bari village located on its eastern side, about six km from Bhandardara. It can be reached by road, via Igatpuri&#xA0; on the Mumbai-Nasik route.To reach the summit there are well designated trekking routes.The most popular route is through the eastern mountain face taking off from the base village Bari. The truncated summit provides a modest area of flat land which holds a sacred temple of a local deity. Local legend says that kalsubai was a house maid residing in a nearby Indorey village. She is believed to have disappeared near the mountain while trying to escape her employer&apos;s relentless torment. This lends the mountain its current name as well as a reason for this temple to be built in her fond memory.It all began on a Saturday night, 04th Aug 2018, when a motley group of about 45 trekking enthusiasts and first-timers gathered at chembur East to board the bus to&#xA0; Bari village. After a bumpy, tiresome 4-hour ride, we finally arrived at the base village and quickly hit the floor for a short nap.After some tossing and turning, I stirred to the sound of someone announcing @7.30 in the morning, &#x201C;Wake up everyone! It&#x2019;s time for the trek.&#x201D; After a light breakfast of delicious poha and tea, we were all raring to go.After a brief round of introductions, we were all set to scale the peak, under the watchful eye of our guide, Mr. Kiran Gaurat, from Trekking Warriors, India.At the outset, we had to cross a rivulet, which morphed into a mini-waterfall a few meters away. Having passed the first obstacle unscathed, we trudged on. The scenery consisted of mainly paddy fields surrounded by lush green foliage with the hills beckoning us in the backdrop.Many of these points provided amazing panoramic views of the surrounding Sahyadri range. The topography varied from muddy tracks to rocky slopes and slippery steps, with patches of plateaus. There were man-made staircases at several spots to support the ascent. Mentally, I thanked my stars for having purchased proper trekking shoes.Around the 75% completion mark, we came across a stall selling hot tea and onion pakoras, the smell of which sent our shivering group&apos;s taste buds into an overdrive. We entered the cozy stall, already jam-packed with other trekkers having similar cravings. While waiting for our snacks.we covered the last leg of our expedition and reached the top within an hour, around 11 am. Nothing could have prepared me for the scene I witnessed- winds howling and rain lashing down on a&#xA0; large number of people gathered- some were huddled together, too cold to move, while the more adventurous ones moved about carefree. There was a small, quaint mandir to pay respects to Kalsubai devi, whose walls offered some protection from the elements.We spent about an hour at the summit.We began the descent during the ascent, I&#x2019;d imagined that the return journey would be more arduous as due to gravity, we would have lesser control over our movements. To the contrary, the descent turned out to be much easier and faster. We touched base within 2 hours. With our hunger satiated, we decided to change into dry clothes.We departed from the village for Mumbai at 5.30 with fond memories of a day well-spent.",

The largest country and closer to North Pole, has affected its vegetation and economic conditions.It&#x2019;s a beautiful country with landscapes, cities, culture, varied food and people and so much to explore.So it must be firstly decided as to what all do you want to see and explore in how much time.We had one week to see Russia and we chose the two major cities St. Petersburg and Moscow.Check the weather before visiting Russia. We visited during end of May 2018.There are only 60 days in the year which experiences sunlight in Russia as told to us by bus driver and local guide at St. Petersburg. We were lucky to have seen sunlight so the weather was good.I felt the change in temperature from cold to hot , form using heaters to using AC in just week.The days were also very long. It became dark at 10 PM and sunrise at 4 AM. For those who would open their whiskeys and scotch before dinner, should do it after drawing the curtains to feel that it&#x2019;s evening.I would advise to check the flights. We didn&#x2019;t get direct flight from India and had to reach st. Petersburg by changing flight from Moscow.St. Petersburg @ 8 PM From India mid night flight, reaching Moscow early morning and then taking domestic flight to st. Petersburg.The traffic is bad in Russia. So plan your trip keeping in mind. Avoid usage of roads there the least.Traffic scenes at St. Petersburg Day 2St PetersburgHotelsMapSt. Petersburg is a historical city, with lot of cathedrals, museums and historical sites. The whole city is a planned city for residential purposes. The building on the road are all well maintained, beautiful architecture and symmetrical to give city a planned look.Residents can park their cars on the road and this causes lot of traffic.Streets are good for pedestrians too.It&#x2019;s overall a small city and can be covered on foot, while enjoying the river Neva and the buildings.Day 1RussiaHotelsMapThe cruise on River Neva is a good mode of city tour. The guide can also explain you the history and you can enjoy snacks and drinks in the cruise.Famous sight seeing places require huge que to buy tickets. Hermitage museum is a very famous and huge one. It has beautiful carvings, famous paintings preserved and roman statutes from ancient times. It is highly recommended who are interested in things like these.These two would take up major part of your day.Do try Borshe, Russian salad and vodka.It&#x2019;s not a very vegan friendly place if you want to go for typical Russian dishes.You can find some indian restaurants if you looking for such.At night, check out shows for circus and ballet. Swan lake is very popular show in St. Petersburg.Even though I did these in Moscow at the famous Bolshoi theatre.architecture on exterior walls of Museum Hermitage Museum River Neva River CruiseHermitage MuseumHotelsMapThe Hermitage museum in St. petersburg is a must visit for almost every person with varied interest. It is huge and often tiring too, but it is worth the visit.The beautiful architecture inside, Depiction of cultural heritage, Famous original painting of famous artists, original roman and Greek statutes, Big chambers and Walking Alleys. You will be able to see all of these with your naked eyes, right infront of you.... it was Oh My God moment for me in the museum... Rather Moments..some famous paintingsBeautiful alleys at the Museum Must see at Hermitage MuseumThe other must visit places in St. Peters burg are :Vasil&apos;yevskiy ostrov: This is a historical Square with Red pillar in the centre. This marks the struggle during historical time. This square is pretty and important as the tourists can shop souvenirs here. This place has major official buildings around this square. It is a nice place to sit, chill and have coffee with a nice view of the Neva river. Old st. Petersburg stock exchange is also here.The church of the Saviour on Blood is one of the beautiful churches I have seen. If you look at the tomb of the church, it is like a fantasy world or a disney world where the roofs were made of Ice cream cones. It is beautiful and colorful.This is a must go place to see the interior as well. The flooring and the ceilings are beautifully made. Mosaic art with lot of golden plating work done giving it a spectacular look. This beauty is well preserved and hence, will ask for entrance fee as well. But i would recommend you to spend it on this and see if you are fond of history, architecture, culture or Christianity. you will see the spot where Alexander II died inside the church.Ceiling inside the churchMarble flooring with cut workIce cream shaped TombsTime for some Russian salads and soupsYou can go for Hop on Hop Off for city tour. It is a good option and you can explore lot of places.St. Issac&apos;s Cathedral is the largest orthodox cathedral in the world. And truly it was huge.Day 4Taking the train to Moscow. This will take up your 3/4th day and then maximum you would want to do is look around the hotel and maybe explore the local supermarket maybe. Though the train journey is not tiring. Each car of the train has its pantry for tea and coffee and some snacks. In each cabin, there is a television with mostly Russian channels, cloth slipper and some snacks for each seater.MoscowHotelsMapBut we went on the night tour. Yes.... Moscow is known for its nightlife. There are tours for nightlife, lot of pubs and cafes to Hop in......One must definitely check out the night life.Moscow has wide roads and much better traffic system . Locals are very particular about U-turns. Even if the road has a gap, the U-turn will be still made at the end of the crossings. No parking area on the road and very civilized when it comes to road ethics.Must see things at night: Walk at the red square, Moscow state university, Arbat street, Gorky park, go to the hill top to see the river and the city lights and the Business centre. Moscow is a very gorgeous city at night.Moscow State UniversityHotelsMapThe Commercial Business Center of Moscow at NightBlurry Nights on the Hill Top in Moscow: View over the cityArbat StreetHotelsMapArbat street : Happening place for youngstersDay 5Red SquareHotelsMapThe very famous Red square is huge area in red walls, red bricks and red architecture. It is historical site plus also holds lot of importance in current political and national activities. It is huge and exploring this place will take you more than half of the day.The popular St. Basil Cathedral at the red square is pretty and built like a fairy land. Even the interiors are such that I felt the doors are made of candy and its all so cute and pretty.The Gum Mall is huge at the red square. It is the worlds largest departmental store.There are shops for souvenirs and other branded stuff as well. The wall of red square on one side is neighboring the governance and sovereign buildings.Red SquareHotelsMapSt. Basil Cathedral GUM mallInside the GUM mallShops at Red Square. This is well lit up at nightThe Very Famous Red SquareRight across the road of the Red Square area, There is Bolshoi Theatre. you can buy tickets online. We bought from the box office itself. Be careful of the black market prevalent here. They will sell you at higher rates. This the largest Ballet theatre in the world.Bolshoi TheatreHotelsMapDay 6MoscowHotelsMapNext day we went for city tour and the Circus.There are lot of places to visit. one can choose as per their preference. I chose planetarium, which was huge built in shape of rocket flying, the satellite tower, Novodevichy convent and tulip garden at Moscow University.In the Evening, We saw the Russian circus. It reminded me of the Bollywood old movie &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;.Tsvetnoy BoulevardHotelsMapDay 7VERNISAGEHotelsMapIf you want to shop local stuff, go to Kremlin Vernisage. But beware of pick pockets. This place is like the local market for all. You can get all Russian items for cheap.Kremlin tour is about exploring the fort and the government area. The house of President and his governance area are all part of Kremlin.This will include few more churches where the royal family visits,their palace can be seen from outside. The entry is restricted and is only with permitted guides.Entrance to the FortressYou can choose to explore any other place in Moscow. I explored the food and desserts.Next day fly off back home......I definitely bought some vodka back home and lots of memories and yes...... recipes of Vegetarian Russian Salads.",

		"Text": "Travelling to Kedarnath has a number of highlights. From the majestic mountains to the warm plates of daal chawal, the destination is filled with surprises that you will not expect them to happen around you. But when you travel in this beautiful region of Garhwal, something that happens unexpectedly is how you run into Bengali travellers and end up learning secrets of walking down the roads less travelled. I tried to visit Kedarnath in 2016, bad weather and continuous landslides made me postpone the trip. But this problem turned into a blessing in disguise. I ended up sharing a jeep with a group of Bengali travellers. Disappointed that the Kedarnath trip didn&#x2019;t happen, they started talking about places that they can travel to instead. And so happened the mention of Kakragad.     \nWhen we talk about birding destinations in Uttarakhand, no one thinks beyond Pangot, Chopta, Naukuchiatal and Corbett. In some ways, these places are well known and have all the facilities that a traveller would love to explore. But what happens when someone wishes to explore something more authentic and find the birds in a more natural, unspoilt habitat. You go to Kakragad     \nTravelling on the Mandakini River&#x2019;s route, you&#x2019;ll find a small village which is very hard to notice. Kakragad is one of the few places which never got the true attention of tourism industry and became a favourite of those who wished to experience village life and wake up to the sound of birds in the morning. A few kilometres from here, the confluence of Akashganga and Mandakini is worth visiting but the best part of this place is how beautifully preserved its natural habitats have been. Kakragad is truly a paradise for birdwatchers. Apart from exquisite species of birds, you&#x2019;ll also find Grey Ghoral, Himalayan Tahars, Martens, and common Himalayan Pikas in this region. The Magpie birding camp located here is the perfect place to spend your vacation. The place is run by Mr. Yashpal Singh Negi, an avid birding enthusiast who is well acquainted with this area. SourceThe birding experience in Kakragad is rewarding. You&#x2019;ll have to wake up at 3 AM in the morning and hike deep into the jungle. This region is absolutely perfect for those who want to test their camera in low light. Spotted forktail, Himalayan Bulbul, Laughing Thrush and Niltava are some of the notable celebrity bird species commonly found here. Griffon Eagles are easy to spot once the sun comes out. As per my experience, Kakragad is the only place where you can go for birding for hours. Major birding enthusiasts are known to get their lunch packed and return straight in the afternoon once they are done with finding everything possible. SourceApart from the Jungle, the river trail is a great place to relax and spot many other varieties of birds. The avifauna which depends on fishing has made this area their habitat. One of the most amazing things to find here is the tiny Brown Dipper that dives deep into the icy river water to catch its prey. He does it over and over again until he succeeds in getting the meal of the day. How to visit Kakragad SourceRegular buses travel between Haridwar/Rishikesh and Kakragad. You need to find a bus travelling towards Kund and you&#x2019;ll have to get down just near Rudraprayad. Here, you need to inform the bus conductor to stop the bus at Kakragad because if you miss your stop, you&#x2019;ll end up travelling far beyond. Kakragad is easy to reach if you have a personal four wheeler. Stay and Birdwatching Guide Mr. Yashpal Singh Negi is the man who&#x2019;ll take you to every nook and corner of this region. An avid birding enthusiast had his earlier camp destroyed in Uttarakhand floods. His new campsite can be booked at 01364-268344, 9412909399.Source&#xA0;A trip to Kakragad can be mixed with Chopta and Tungnath trek. The route is connected and Negi Jee will provide a guide if needed. You can also travel further to Badrinath and Valley of Flowers but you need to have atleast 4 to 6 days extra in your hand.Follow my blog and instagram for more travel stories",

Take the metro from Yenikapi to Zethybrun and then get off and take the Tram T1 going towards Lavitas and get off at Sultanhemet. After taking the epic balloon ride in Cappadocia, we were ready to explore the historical side of Istanbul. Oncewe checked in to Nowy Efendi Hotel and rested for a while and later headed to Cigden to have some delectable borek and pastry. This caf&#xE9; is a must and they serve some incredible desserts.Borek\nDay 4ÇemberlitaşHotelsMapSince we were quite fatigued with all the trekking we did in Cappadocia we thought of pampering ourselves with some soothing massage. We had booked a time slot with Cemberlitas Hamami and I wish I had been forewarned about their HORRIBLE service. For 160 TL we hardly got any scrub and the whole process was a rushed affair. No one directs you about the process, you aimlessly ramble to figure things out on your own. By the time you realize you are experiencing the famed Turkish hamam, its over! We hardly spent 20 minutes after entering the hamam and that includes everything. I would not recommend this place at all! Save your money and go to some less popular Hamams, I&#x2019;m sure you will get better service.With a bitter feeling we then headed to pick some souvenirs from various shops at Sultanhemet. We even got a kg of clothes washed at Active laundry for 10 liras. Must visit is Zakka Souvenir store, little ahead of the sultanhemet tram stop, on the left side. It&#x2019;s moderately priced and there is no bargaining. We even explored the Ramadan Market and its very lively and lots of shops and food stalls around.Fatih Sultan Mehmet MahallesiHotelsMapMust try is Mango black tea frappe at Starbucks on Sultanhemet. Priced at 11.50 liras its total value for money and very refreshing and much needed after all the shopping and gallivanting.little ahead of Sultanhemet tram stn on the left sideMango Black tea frappeSultanhemet SquareRamadan MarketHobyar MahallesiHotelsMapDay 5 &#x2013; 21st May 2018, after having a scrumptious breakfast (cornflakes, paneer, cheese, jams, breads, potato wedges, cake, fruits, juices and coffee/tea) at Nowy Efendi Hotel, we proceeded to Topkapi Palace. We brought our museum pass from here as we reached at 9 am there was no rush and we could get the pass easily. For 125 TL this pass is value for money provided sites are not under restoration.Topkapi palace was the residence of the ottoman Sultans and was also used for educational and administrative affairs of the state. There are various courtyards and gardens and the Harem, kitchen and treasury are must go. Some sections of the palace are under restoration. The Archaeological Museum and Church of Hagia Irene are under major restoration and hence not accessible. Audio guide is available at the entrance and can be purchased to get an overview about the History. There is a lovely caf&#xE9; overlooking the Bosphorous inside the Palace and some nice but overpriced cafes in the garden too. Topkapi Palace is built on top of the Byzantine acropolis and is surrounded by the Sea of Marmara, Bosphorous, and the Golden Horn. The rose garden houses some unbelievably huge roses and it looks beautiful. Make sure to visit all the 4 courtyards and you can easily spend 4-5 hours exploring the palace especially if you are a History Buff!the garden as you enter the palace areaview of the golden horn from the palacebeautiful Iznik tilesBreakfast at Nowy EfendiRoses in the courtyard gardenCeiling art at the palacebeautiful and intricate artworkPost this we headed to Grande Caf&#xE9; for Lunch, we ate Kumpir which can be made vegetarian and is loaded with fresh vegetables and cheese/mayo stuffed inside a huge boiled potato. The orange juice was refreshing and much needed after all the walking. For 24TL you can have a good lunch and re-pack all the lost energy!Day 5EMİNÖNÜ MISIR ÇARŞISIHotelsMapWe then headed to Spice Bazaar and took the metro from Sultanhemet to Eminonu and look for Misir Carsisi or spice bazaar. It is also called the Egyptian bazaar and is one of the largest covered markets after grand bazaar. You get variety of spices, teas, Turkish delight, and nuts. My friend picked up some lokum and I brought heavenly Cikolata Chocolates for 15 Tl (PS: Try the Starwberry flavored cikolata- it&#x2019;s Yummylicious). It&#x2019;s on the left side of the famous coffee shop Mehmet Efendi in the market. Unless you really want to pick up spices, one hour is good for exploring this place and one should be careful about the attire and belongings as it&#x2019;s crowded.entrance to the spice bazaaramazing varietydifferent types of teaKumpir at Grande cafe Sultan Ahmet MahallesiHotelsMapWe then headed back to Sultanhemet and walked it up to Arasta Bazaar. It&#x2019;s very close to the tram station and Blue Mosque. One needs to be vigilant while going to this place as we were approached by a salesman and he forced us to visit his shop. We denied 3-4 times but he insisted. Since his shop (Topkapi) was right at the beginning of the bazaar we decided to pay it a visit to get rid of him. He showed us few tea samples and I loved the Jasmine flavored tea. Little did I know that I was falling in a trap! He sold 100 grams of tea for 70 TL whereas the same thing was available for 36 TL a little ahead. I felt robbed! I went back to him to reason out with him but it was futile.Arasta ÇarşısıHotelsMapArasta Bazaar houses few shops which are mostly empty. It&#x2019;s overpriced and there is nothing extra ordinary about this place. The only shop worth a visit would be Jennifer&#x2019;s Hamam, they have some high quality linen towels starting at 35 TL and soaps for 5 TL which are worth a look and if it suits your pocket then you should certainly pick some.Beyazıt MahallesiHotelsMapIt was now time to explore one of the biggest covered market in World: The Grand Bazaar &#x201C;Kapil Carisi&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s truly grand in every sense. The easiest way is to take the tram from Sultanhemet to Carisikapi stop heading towards Bagicilar. You can walk it up as well but save your energy for all the walking within the bazaar as there are endless number of lanes. We picked up few ceramic hot plates, Istanbul T-shirts for 15 TL each, evil eyes ranging from 15 to 50 TL or may be more, Turkish towels for 15 TL and many more souvenirs. There are dedicated lanes for various things like leather, ceramics, lokum, towels etc. One can easily spend few hours here and if you really intend to shop a lot then may be half a day! Remember to hone your bargaining skills before you enter the market, as it will certainly come handy.Dervişali MahallesiHotelsMapWe had some fresh orange juice outside the market and then headed to Chora Church. You need to take the tram from Sultanhemet towards Bagicilar and get off at topkapi stop. Climb the steps and take the Tram T4 to Edrinekapi Stop. From there you need to ask people for Kariye Museum and it takes a good 10 minutes to reach. The overall time for one way journey is 45 minutes. After all the effort, once we reached we realized that only one small section of the church is open, everything else is under restoration. What a put off! They are even selling audio guides for that section. I really wonder why? It took barely 5 minutes to see the small room and it was very disappointing. In my opinion, skip it until it&#x2019;s fully restored.We called it a day off with some warm dinner at &#x2018;Be So&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s in the by-lanes of Sultanhemet and close to our hotel Nowy Efendi. We ordered a vegetarian pizza along with some crispy fries and baklava. They even served us complimentary Turkish tea. We paid around 30 TL per person and they even played some amazing music and there is free Wi-Fi too.Pizza and fries at BE-SOAmazing Turkish TeaBaklavaDay 6Hagia Sophia ChurchHotelsMapDay 6- 22nd May 2018 &#x2013; we started our day with the visit to Hagia Sophia or Ayasofya, the architectural grandeur in Istanbul! It was first a church, then a mosque and now a museum. It&#x2019;s an example of how diversity can co-exist all under the same roof! It was built in the 6th Century and stands tall and strong till date. Some parts of it are under restoration but majority is accessible. Audio guide to the different sections and mosaics can be rented for 30 TL. The entrance was included in the Museum pass. One can spend a good 2 hours or may be more at this architectural wonder housing incredible frescoes and pillars. Preferably go early in the morning as it gets very crowded later.Majestic Hagia Sophia from InsideView from the top most floorSultan Ahmet MahallesiHotelsMapWe then headed to the Blue Mosque or Sultan Ahmed Mosque, which is at a distance of 5 minutes from Hagia Sophia. One needs to dress appropriately and they even rent clothes free of charge if you are not appropriately dressed. Full sleeves Tshirt and Full Length Jeans with no revelation is the rule. You need to cover your head, hence carry a scarf. The mosque is known as blue mosque as its walls are surrounded with blue tiles. It&#x2019;s an active mosque and hence closed for non-worshipers during prayer times five times a day for around 90 minutes. You need to get your shoes off and carry them in a plastic bag with you. It&#x2019;s a majestic ottoman mosque and is of great historical importance.Alemdar MahallesiHotelsMapWe then proceeded to Basilica Cistern which is right opposite the Hagia Sophia. Entrance fee is 20 TL and this place can be skipped totally. It&#x2019;s under restoration and all you see is Melusa&#x2019;s Head and some History about it. It&#x2019;s dingy inside and over hyped tourist attraction. It was constructed using 336 columns and is the largest byzantine cistern which has survived till date. It can hold up to 17.5 million gallons of water! It&#x2019;s open to visitors from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm. The historical facts are written inside hence you don&#x2019;t need any audio or private guide. The history behind the crying pillar is interesting.Süleymaniye Mah.HotelsMapOn our cultural exploration day, our last stop was the Sulemnaiye Mosque. It&#x2019;s one of the most Magnificent Mosques in Istanbul and was designed by the ace architect Sinan. To reach the mosque take the tram to Grand Bazaar and walk straight ahead of the main entrance where all the clothes shops are lined up. Walk till the end of the lane and turn left and then few more steps and take a right. You can get panoramic view of the Golden horn and Bosphorous from the garden and I personally felt very peaceful here. There is a calm aura to it and much less crowded than the Blue Mosque. Entrance is free and there is dress code to follow. Please carry a scarf and respect people while they are praying. We sat outside the Mosque for few minutes and the view is beautiful. There is a functional Hamam on the eastern side of the Mosque and is considered one of the best in Istanbul. I wish we had visited this instead of Cemberlitias. You can also visit the tomb of Architect Sinan.Bayrampaşa/IstanbulHotelsMapWe then headed back to our hotel to take the evening bus to Fethiye from the main bus station called Otogar (Byrampasa). We had booked our bus tickets for Metro Turizm in advance via neredennereye.com The price was 110 TL and it takes roughly 11-12 hours to reach Fethiye otogar or bus terminal. To reach the Otogar in Istanbul we took the tram from sultanhemet to akasaray and from there take the metro from Yenikapi to Otogar. As you arrive at the Bus terminal there are hundreds of offices, we had to go to office no 49 and from there to office no 110 to board the bus. Be very careful of your bag and money. Don&#x2019;t open your wallet while you are occupied asking for directions. Seating is comfortable and there is no Wi-Fi in the bus. It halts a couple of times to answer natures call and the journey is smooth and efficient. They even serve you tea/coffee and some biscuit twice during the journey. You can use the restroom at various stops for a nominal charge of 1.75 TL. It gets slightly cold in the night hence carry a scarf or a thin blanket.",

		"Text": "BenarasHotelsMapBenaras, known as the City of the Ganges or Kashi, the City of Lord Shiva has been attracting millions of travellers for centuries for its mystic nature. However, we were not only fascinated by its charming ghats and old town but also the underground handloom industry that has existed since buddha! Textiles and Temples are the key themes of Benaras and we delved deeper into the area of Peeli Kothi with locals who introduced us to weavers who have been part of the heirloom business for many generations and work on creating fabrics and saris made of pure silk yarn. Interestingly Benaras is a city where buddhism meets hinduism but most weavers are from the Muslim community.One of the first people we met was Navneet, a cultural entrepreneur and curator who founded kirti gallery that organises a residency program to conserve and document Varanasi&apos;s culture. He is extensively involved in the local conservation , exploration and facilitation projects. While chatting he tells us about the last few Sindhoor trees in the city out of which he owns one! He further shares that the kirti gallery runs on a self sustaining model where he does not engage in active marketing and it depends on its community and word of mouth. He works with non decorative artists and does not engage in the investment industry. One of his projects is to facilitate the existing weavers community. He explains that the weavers community is managed by master weave and there are 3 main areas in Varanasi where artisans industry resides. Peeli kothi / Alipura is the most innovative, Lohta is mostly power looms now and Madanpura is the most traditional. Weavers work with people they trust. Further into this discussion we understood the active role of Pupul Jaikar, Kamla chatopadhya and Rajiv Sethi in the industry.Naseem, one the weavers we met told us that most of the yarn comes from China or from a Silweta close to Bangalore and Bhagalpur in Bengal. The Yarn is twisted in Benaras and then dyed. The process involves up to 10 artisans apart from the weaver. After the process of dying, it takes up to 25 days on a handloom machine to make one sari! Most patterns are still inspired by flora and fauna, however, designers are re-inventing the potential of this cottage industry and geometric and more contemporary repeats can also be found in this hidden gem. Further a master weaver in Madanpura opens a few saris for us and tries to know what we were looking for. On inspection he tells us that the price of the sari goes up by the number of threads used. Some Jamdanis and cut work Dupattas were shown to us with silver and gold Zari. Patterns like Jamavar are the most traditional and exotic now. Some varieties of silks that can be found here are organza, tissue, brocade, matar, mashru, moga, tussar, mulberry, eri, tanchoi, dupian and kataan.Jitendra from Luxury to Loom spent an afternoon with us sharing his pool of knowledge and a very interesting story of serendipity with us. I was curious to know about the ethical processes, and he shares that he has visited the units near Bangalore to see how the silk cocoon is procured however, most yarn used now comes from china as it is the stongest when making mass products in the garment industry, and no comments can be made on its ethical choices. Another question I had was &apos;How do i tell its handloom?&apos; He shared that Handloom cannot be a piece more than 10m and usually it has punching marks on the side and bigger ends of threads. Jitendra plays a role of a middle man between the designers and artisans and facilitates the capabitity of artisans to adapt. In 2004 he had left his hometown in Bihar to study in Chandigarh after chasing a bollywood dream and landed in Varanasi by accident. Now 6 years in the industry and having worked with organisations like NEST and brands like Prada and Dior, he is also involved in the sustainable growth and community work. He complains that a lot has been said about helping the artisans but not too many notice the other people involved in the process at various stages like dyers, loom makers, spinners etc. Through Luxury to Loom, he wishes to create 365 days of employment for this community.An interesting fact and rarely would people know that Benaras is the city where king Siddhartha&apos;s brocades were woven and also one of the largest cottage industry to wooden toys! Next time you are in this charming city, do not forget to bring back some and support the craft.Words and photos by Sayali Goyal.",

Yes, its sinfully beautiful and the more you explore, more you learn about this state and why does it exist in a certain way.This trip was planned with family, that is my husband and parents.We started from Delhi by Train, we took Shatabdi Train and reached Chandigarh in 4 hrs.We had booked a cab for our 2 day trip from Chandigarh. So the driver picked us up from the Railway station, we stopped on the way to eat scrumptious punjabi food at Pal Dhaba and believe me i ate one of the best Kadhi Pakoda i have ever had.It took almost 2.5 hrs from there to reach Chail.\nChail PalaceHotelsMapWe stayed at Himachal tourism guest house i.e. the Chail Palace and believe me its one of the most beautiful government properties to stay in.The bookings were done online on the their official website.I have fairly had good experiences using government owned guest houses while travelling.They are well maintained and have the best scenic spot of the place.The view from our coutyardThe beautiful PalaceThe sun downers are always mesmerizing!Surrounded by Deodar Trees on all the sides, its a grand picturesque view everywhere you look.The sunrises and sunsets are just perfect from there.There is also a small local market nearby the palace with some local restaurant, a few grocery and confectionery stores.Do not expect shopping around here.Just sink in the beauty of the place with a cup of tea/coffee and that&apos;s all you want.The best part about or stay here was the food, they have only one restaurant in the palace with such amazing food.A good variety with even Himachali food options, the food here will not disappoint you.A long stroll across the palace was very satisfying and enriching experience for me.Coming from Mumbai with the hustle bustle of the city, this is what i wanted to experience on my Birthday, my special day with people i love the most.The hangout spot!Another Cafe here and the Husband",

We pre booked our stay at a hotel (Ram Guest House) on M.G Road. after the check-in, we got freshen up and headed to the beach road for a walk where we ended up staying till 1.30 am. There were still people around playing and walking around at this time. You have spend a good amount of time with food being served at this cafe beside Gandhi statue called Le Cafe. We went back and arrived at around 5.30 am in the morning for sunrise. Later after spending few minutes at the beach and taking photos, we walked around the White town and French Colony for abreakfast and morning tea. We hired cycles which costs around Rs. 100 per day for goign around. We also visited the famous Manakula Vinayagar temple and other famous foo outlets like Baker&apos;s street, Cafe Xtasi, Eat my cake etc., The brick oven pizza at Cafe xtasi is a must try if you are going to pondicherry. Expensive though but worth the money. we also tried GMT ice cream. Try Bacardi gelato there. Since there was a time crunch, we couldn&apos;t go to Auroville. But this place is a retreat if you would like to relax and get away from city chaos. Try the cafes that are in and around Auroville which has got some healthy french breakfasts and snacks.",

		"Text": "Singapore might be one of the smallest nations in the world but every square inch of the island country has been perfected to welcome its guests. The name Singapore originated from the Sanskrit word, &#x2018;Singapura&#x2018;, the Land of the Lions.Singapore is my second international tour in recent times, sixth overall and has been my best trip till date. We were flying with Air India, which didn&#x2019;t have a connecting flight from Kolkata to Singapore. So we traveled via New Delhi.\nDay 1Little IndiaHotelsMapDAY 1We arrived at the Changi International Airport at Singapore on 16th January 2016. The airport is considered to be best airport in the world and it truly deserves the award. The airport boasts of a Cactus Garden, a Butterfly Park, Swimming Pool with Jacuzzi, Water Lily Garden, Kinetic Rain centerpiece, Piazza Garden, a Business Center and a Play Area!We stayed at the Royal India Guest House in Little India area. There was Pongal celebration going on during that time and the streets were decorated quite beautifully. The neighbourhood, true to its name is full of Indians and you can easily find store names written in Hindi.Places Visited :-Mustafa CenterSingapore Night SafariSingapore doesn&#x2019;t believe in mediocracy. It has the best airport and then the Mustafa Center, which is one of the largest shopping malls in the world. People say that it takes roughly three days to walk through the entire building. There&#x2019;s no such thing which you cannot buy at Mustafa! It houses almost everything under the Sun. The Night Safari was a wonderful experience. We saw lions at a few hands distance with nothing but some tall grasses separating us. There were elephants, leopards, giraffes, hyenas, gaurs, flamingos, zebras and a variety of other wild animals.Mustafa Day 2Sentosa islandHotelsMapDAY 2Well, like I said Mustafa takes days to finish and its not just any other shopping mall on the planet. It has its own beauty which cannot be described in writing. Which is why we decided to visit another wing of the place before starting our journey.Places Visited :-Mustafa CenterSentosa IslandFaber Peak Cable Car StationThe MerlionDolphin ShowUnderwater AquariumPalawan BeachWings of Time Light and Sound Show.Which brings me to Sentosa. If I could, I would have stayed back at the island. And I am serious about it. The glitch is there&#x2019;s no residence permit at the island. Sentosa is the loveliest place I have been to. Trust me, even if I were offered an unlimited buffet place, I would still choose Sentosa on any given day. You haven&#x2019;t seen anything if you come to Singapore and don&#x2019;t visit this place. All the places mentioned from Faber Peak are destinations located at this island only. And you know the best part of the entire trip? The Light and Sound Show here.A stillDay 3Marina Bay Sands HotelHotelsMapDAY 3We still had two wings left to cover at the Mustafa but decided to postpone it to the next day. We went out for a city tour instead. There was a bus service that can be availed by the tourists for free which guides you through the entire city.Places Visited :-Marina Bay Sands HotelGardens by the BaySingapore SkywalkerMerlionChina TownNow the most striking feature about the Sands is that although it is a hotel, the bottom three floors host a shopping mall. This is not only a prominent building depicted in the Singapore skyline but has a canal inside it too, where you can row your own gondolas! Imagine a canal where you can boat, that too inside a skyscraper! How cool is that!Marina Bay SandsDay 4Outback SteakhouseHotelsMapDAY 4Most of the day was spent at Mustafa itself. We visited the Outback Steakhouse at Orchard Avenue where we had a dinner invitation. The restaurant had an Australian cuisine. I tried quite a few items like Ham, Bacon, Salmon for the first time. The food was just delicious!Gardens By the BayIt was time to say goodbye to this amazing island nation! We had an early morning flight to catch. We made a halt at New Delhi, stayed there for a day and came to Kolkata the following day.A token from the MerlionCombining the skyscrapers and subways of a modern, affluent city with a medley of Chinese, Malay and Indian influences and a tropical climate, with tasty food, good shopping and a vibrant night-life scene, this is a place where one should definitely travel at least once in their lifetime!Sentosa Merlion",

		"Text": "BrazilHotelsMapThe silence and the uncertainty of forest is what make them adventurous and serene at the same time. The largest broad-leaved forest on Earth with its diverse ecosystem and humongous size is a place of pure imagination for travelers and forest connoisseurs. The Amazon which shelters close to 25000 plant species, 1500 bird species and a long list of reptiles, mammals and amphibians is a must visit for any fellow traveler on Earth. Situated mainly in Brazil it is not an easy destination to reach and explore. The forest expands across countries like Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia as well. We will focus on exploring the mysterious and obscure parts of the forest in Brazil.When to Go and Duration of VisitBecause of such greeneries this area receives torrential rain covers half of the year. The rainy season presides from December to June. July-December face the drier seasons and is the most favorable time to visit. As the rains stops, rivers recedes exposing fine forest trails, hiking roadways, places for fishing and mythical caves. make sure to get your flight tickets a bit early and by that you will get tickets around 1.5 lakhs including both sidesIf you are planning it without any packages or groups, you will need 10 days to explore the essence of the forest because all hiring of boats, small lodges are on you. A week is enough for package travelers. If you are planning for longer visits it is advisable to cover other parts of Amazon rather than staying at a single place.Rio de JaneiroHotelsMapHow to travelOne can either opt for independent travel or for packaged tours. The nearest airports are Manaus or Rio De Janerio from where one can book buses or cabs that ply to the river ports. There are a gamut of options from ultra-luxury to basic shacks in major parks like Tambopata, Mamiraua, Manu. It is better to get in touch with some operators for transfers because most part of the trips are in remote areas which actually can be a challenge for novice travelers to arrange food, drink and water.Google imagesGoogle imagesManausHotelsMapFor a more edgy experience try booking a jungle lodge. Most of them have private rooms, meals and excursions bundled in the package. It also includes hikes in jungle . Try Manuas Amazon Antonio Jungle Tours and Amazon Gero Tours for affordable rates. Riverboats are another way to explore the serene jungle. They have deluxe berths and hammocks but the trip would last around 10 days in this case. For this Amazon Eco Adventures and Lo Piex are good options. One can also indulge in tree climbing, fishing, bird watching, photography. Long hikes and special canoe trips can be arranged for customized trips to explore more wildlife. You can also visit local tribes, cayman spotting and piranha fishing.Google imagesCostsIt is the most important factor in this trip. Remember solo trips here can actually cost you more money because the boats and other arrangements are better to get shared. It also would require knowledge and skill to survive in the rainforest and river for a week. Most jungle lodges and riverboat packages are crafted on per person/per day including accommodation, food, water, excursions, guides and transport. Affordable budget lodges range from 75 $ USD to 125$ USD pp/pd while riverboat packages from 1504 USD to 250$ USD pp/pd.Essentials to carryThe Rainforest is hot and humid but at the same time it gets heavy torrential downpours which makes normal clothes tough to get dry. Long pants are must because of obnoxious mosquitoes and shorts for your comfy night sleep inside the tents. Get 4 super dry t-shirts as you can expect them to get wet in rivers and rains and also want them to get dry easily. Wear long sleeve shirts after rain and in hot afternoons to prevent sunburns. Don&#x2019;t forget to get rain-jackets to withstand sporadic rains. A sturdy pair of trekking shoes would be good with rubber soles. Flip flops for room to provide your foot enough breathing space. Get enough pair of underwear to prevent any itching. Headlamps or torches are essential to hike and walk when the light drops suddenly. Medicine-wise mosquito repellent, vomiting and nausea medicines along with sunscreen are significant things to carry. Take some bug sprays and after bite lotions for some emergencies.Note : Travel Insurance is a must for every travelers",

		"Text": "This 26-year-old travel blogger is a self proclaimed hyper travel monkey, who loves strange foods, bright colours and chilling out. Brought up in a protective household of a small town in Odisha, Ankita Kumar now loves to backpack and travel solo, and has spent four months in South America on her own. She has just returned from a 100-day-long road trip across India in a caravan, and is now planning a two-month trip to Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. And in the midst of this planning, she found time to talk to me and amaze me with her inspiring travel stories. \t  \tExcerpts from the interview:When did the travel bug bite you? I was working at a production house in Mumbai, I was living in a dingy house, as I was not earning much, and I realised this was it. I couldn&apos;t take it anymore, so I decided to go back to Bangalore, where I had done my graduation. That&apos;s when I decided to travel, I started saving and went to Vietnam for a month. I tried to squeeze in every travel experience that I could as I thought I&apos;d never be able to travel again!Only after I returned, did I realise this could not be it, I just couldn&apos;t accept the fact that I wouldn&apos;t travel again, I wanted to go on a trip again and often and that&apos;s when the travel bug bit me. And then nothing could stop you! So how much of the world have you seen?Pretty much all of India, I have been to all parts of India and I have loved it totally! I have covered almost all of Southeast Asia, New Zealand and spent 4 months in South America on a solo trip. I also just went on a 100-day-long road trip in a caravan from Bangalore that ended all the way up in the north! \t  \tOh yes! That caravan road trip! Tell me more about it!We have practically chased the summer in our self-made orange van! The idea was to bring caravan travel culture to India, and also experience every bit of India on our road trip, so we spread it over 100 days. We went from Kerala to Rann of Kutch to Himachal Pradesh. This one time the brakes failed near Mandi, we were at the highway. It ended up in a bad accident, but we managed to get out of it. That is something! I&apos;m glad you guys made out of it safely! What other challenges have you faced during your travels?I think safety is one issue for women when they&apos;re traveling solo. There are unexplored places and cultures that we know nothing about, so safety becomes an issue. Also speaking of culture, language is a huge barrier in foreign lands.While I was in South America I realised how imperative it is to be able to speak the same language, I found myself speaking in sign language, gestures and through pictures. So language is a huge challenge when we travel to distant places. \t  \tAnd speaking of safety, how do your parents take it when it comes to travelling and doing solo trips?I come from a small town in Odisha, called Rourkela, I have grown up in a middle class protective household. I was not allowed to stay out after 5:30 in the evening, I was not allowed to have sleepovers, or talk to boys. I was not even allowed to wear sleeveless clothes. And now I travel solo to different countries for several months on my own, so this has not been easy. I used to lie initially, I would tell them I was going with my friends, when I was doing it solo, but then one day I told them, &quot;I am going to go whether you like it or not, this is what I love to do. And you can either know where I am, or I&apos;m gonna have to lie to you, but I&apos;m gonna go anyway!&quot;I&apos;m resonating with you on so many levels - small town, middle class family and lying to them! How did they react the first time you told them, and how are they taking it now?It&apos;s difficult only the first time and never again. My father did not speak to me for three weeks straight, when I first told him about my Indonesia and Malaysia trip. Then one day he called me up and asked me about my plans, and he&apos;s been excited ever since. They&apos;re my strength now, and my greatest motivation, they are excited like children, every time I return from a trip. Sometimes more excited than me!\t  \tThat&apos;s actually inspiring, I&apos;m gonna have to do the same! Have you taken any trips with them, or do you plan to?As a matter of fact, yes next year itself! I&apos;m planning to send them on a nice trip, I&apos;m saving good money for it. I&apos;ll probably join them on it too. Talking about money, here comes the big question that everyone wants to know, how do you manage your funds to travel so much? Initially I used to rely only on my savings. Finances and self-sufficiency is important, so I never ignored that part. Then one of my friends suggested I start a blog, and write to various companies. I anyway loved taking pictures, and that&apos;s how sponsorship started. My big break was when I got a sponsorship from Titan Raga. I got a feature on Conde Nast for New Zealand. I went on to work with Levi&apos;s, Google, SOTC and more. Wow, that&apos;s huge! Given the pace at which you&apos;re going I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll run out of places pretty soon. What is your take on that?That is difficult to imagine right now, it&apos;s weird when I say it, but sometimes I feel like I need a break, I miss my bed and home cooked food. That&apos;s when I need a vacation from my vacations and simply do nothing. Sometimes it does get tiring, and I just feel like laying in my bed, and not be travelling or planning about it. What are your plans next, where are you travelling to, and for how long?I&apos;m planning on a 2 month trip right now. Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet have long been on my list, and then I wish to attend the Ziro Music Festival. After that I come back home. It&apos;s gonna be crazy!Most certainly looks like it! What do you say your craziest experience has been so far?Visiting the Galapagos Islands, definitely! It is so rich in wildlife, most of the animals that I saw there, are not found anywhere else in the world. I swam with sting rays, manta rays and I saw fish chasing sea horses. The experience was surreal. And then I came across a huge anaconda during my Amazon survival camp days. I&apos;m looking forward to more such experiences on future trips. \t  \tAnd that&apos;s when she signed off, leaving me in awe and with so much inspiration. Ankita Kumar is the &apos;it&apos; girl, with so much understanding, passion and love for what she does. She is surely an inspiration for everyone who has only dreamed of magic and never gone out of their way to achieve it. Have you been inspired by any such traveller?

		"Text": "Sometimes unplanned journeys brings with it beautiful memories. It so happened that I ventured into this place called Lakkundi when I had to accompany my brother during one of his official visits to Gadag. Lakkundi is located on the way to Hampi from Gadag, about 11km away. This place consists of ancient temples with marvelous architecture. This place is recommended for those who are Antiquarians. History Lakkundi is also known as &apos;Lokki Gundi&apos;. Lakkundi was ruled by Chalukyas, Kalachuris, Seuna and the Hoysalas between 09th to 12th Centuries. The Hindu &amp; Jain temples, wells, inscriptions and museum are a testimony of the forgotten paradise. More than 50 numbers of temples, step wells (also called as Kalyani), many inscriptions etc., that were built during the rule of different dynasties are scattered throughout the present village. The architecture of the Kalyani Chalukya dynasty are said to be a link between those of the early Chalukyas of Badami and the Hoysalas who succeeded them.Places of attraction in Lakkundi:1.\tLakkundi Museum: a one-time permit ticket which is nominally charged by ASI has to be bought at the museum before starting one&#x2019;s exploration around Lakkundi. Museum houses a Sculpture Gallery, maintained by the Archeological Survey of India which shows glimpse of Lakkundi architecture. Photography inside the museum is restricted.Unfortunately, there is no personal or audio guide facility to explain about the temples in Lakkundi. During my visit, I sought the help of the locals and workers around the temple to understand the depictions. 2.\tBramha Jainalaya: this temple is located just behind the museum. This temple seems to be constructed during 11th century in typical Chalukya style. The temple has single shrine (ekakuta vimana) connected to a closed mantapa hall via a vestibule (ardhamantapa) that is connected to another open mantapa.LAKKUNDI, KARNATAKA, INDIA(In Pic: Bramha Jainalya Temple)3.\tKasi Vishwanatha (Kasi Visvesvara) Temple: This is the most ornate and elaborately furnished temple among others. One can enjoy distinct and more elaborate stone carvings in this temple. Each stone pillar has different set of carvings depicting a different story. This is a double shrine temple. The shrine facing east is dedicated to Kasi Visvesvara (Hindu god Shiva) whose universal symbol is a linga. The other shrine, which faces the main shrine is dedicated to the sun god Surya also called Suryanarayana. The Surya shrine faces west, an unusual occurrence among Surya temples, which normally face east. It can be observed that special attention has been paid to the moldings, arches and other details on the tower, specially the decorations on doorjambs and lintels.(In Pic: Kasi Vishwanatha (Kasi Visvesvara Temple)Stone carving on the Main DoorStone carving on the temple wall 4.\tMuskin Bhavi (Step Well): This step well is located behind the main bus stand of Lakkundi. The initial approach road is not in a good condition but after few meters concrete road is constructed upto desired location. This step well is a part of the Manikesvara Temple (again dedicated to hindu god Shiva). There are numerous ancient wells in Lakkundi, of which the Chateer Bavi, Kanne Bavi and Muskin Bhavi are popular for their carvings and architectural beauty.The entry on the steps is restricted as a part of safety and maintenance however the beauty of the place can still be enjoyed from the line of barricading.In Pic:Muskin Bhanvi step wellHow to reach Lakkundi: Nearest Airport: Belagavi or HuballiNearest Railhead: Gadag Junction or Huballi Road: Lakkundi is well connected by roads.Distance from Lakkundi by road:Gadag: 11 kmBadami: 68 kmHubli: 60 kmBangalore: 400 kmWhere to stay: Lodging and boarding facilities are available at Gadag.Please note that since there is a limited lunch option in Lakkundi, carrying food/ eatables is feasible till one can reach Gadag.Required time to explore Lakkundi For thorough exploration of above mentioned temples it will require 4 to 5 hours. All the temples are located within 2km radius from the museum. The efforts of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in maintaining and preserving these structures are highly appreciable. The perimeter of the temples are very tidy and even the lawns around these temples are very well maintained. As visitors, it is our moral responsibility to maintain these places without littering the premises.",

		"Text": "Day 1Tungareshwar WaterfallHotelsMapDisclaimer: It&apos;s a rainy season special offering for nature enthusiasts. If it&apos;s not raining you should probably wait for the rains to come and then go. Places to look here: Tungareshwar temple, tungareshwar hill and Shri Sadanand Maharaj Ashram.Highlight of the visit: fiercely strong mud filled waterfalls formed due to rain, gushing through the zigzag settings of boulders. Scary, roaring like a lion. You feel like running and getting out as soon as you can, but they hypnotize you and you will stand staring at it more than you think you will. The reverberation of the running water hitting the periphery of spherical shiny black rocks amidst the lush greenery sets the mood for the entire walk. To be true the entire hill of tungareshwar temple has a road good enough for a car to drive, so there&apos;s no adventure there given any bright sunny day or if it&apos;s drizzling. The lush green wild trees and little streams of water, a big well in the field or a road with tree canopies for those long walks. I mean who will want to walk on a road for 6-7 km at a stretch if you are doing nothing but just walking on a road carved out on a hill with naked rocks to cover on one side. You can do that at many places in Mumbai. Still I went there.How do you get to Tungareshwar? Get into a train to Vasai. After getting out of the station towards east get to the busstand. You can get a bus for tungareshwar from here, or you can hire an auto for &#x20B9;100. It will drop you at a bridge from where the gates for Tungareshwar can easily be seen. A km&apos;s walk after crossing the gate through the village, you can ask anyone where to for Tungareshwar and anyone will gladly direct you towards it. You can find many people going there as you have a temple and an ashram. If it has been raining in mumbai decently for a week or more, then this is the best place to be, without putting in any efforts for getting here or after getting here. It starts with crossing a broken bridge and a moderately paced stream with knee deep flowing water. The flow can get little stronger so you should be careful. Moving forward your will find small waterfalls with milk white water suitable to bathe in. This trip was more than fun for me. A little more than adventurous and little less than havoc. It had been raining the whole week and the entire hill ranges are painted green now. Rapid streams of rain water had formed miniature waterfalls throughout the route, decorating the already beautiful green walls on one side. The roads have been intelligently made with a canal parallel to it so if it rains and the water flows down from the sides and doesn&apos;t comes on the road. Also where the flow of water is stronger they have created a bigger pit and laid large cement water pipes underneath the road for the water to flow down without creating any trouble on the roads. The temple is not too far and you will reach there in 15 minutes of walking. From here on the road gets steeper and you might not see many people going beyond the temple. I hardly found 10 people throughout the journey coming past the temple, and it felt great experiencing the nature unadulterated by the human presence. The rain was respectable and it did deter and scare us, as we didn&apos;t see a soul. But at every turn there are these small waterfalls that keep luring you. There are a few points where you can get a 200&#xB0; wide view of the hills on other side. You will also see a huge waterfall on opposing hill with the sound of its gushing water reaching your ears. This point should the highest elevation you will attain on this walk and will now move to the other side of the hill.Now did the fun really start, when the rains got a little more intense, and even though we had our raincoat, it was of no use. We were drenched in water Top to bottom. The canals made on the sides of the roads were overflowing and the water was on the roads, being an indicator that we should hurry now. At places where the density of trees is more and the road narrower, the tree canopies make it dark and due to the fog the visibility is not more than 50-60 mtrs. It was again scary and we did think about going back but no. Moving forward you will see a large field where you can rest. There&apos;s also a well nearby. You are now near the Swami Sadanand ashram. From here on it&apos;s like another hour of walking and you will get down on a state highway where you can get a bus for Parol naka. Here you can find buses for Vasai or Bhiwandi. The journey back from here was an another adventure. Instead of taking the bus I took a lift from truck going towards Bhiwandi. Unfortunately, it had rained heavily that day and the Vasai Virar side was flooded. The roads were flooded and the entire fields on both the sides of road field with water too. At some points the road couldn&apos;t be crossed with a small vehicle as it would have drowned. For me it was a good decision to take the truck. We did reach bhiwandi safely. But this is a completely different thing and not at all related to the tungareshwar trip. All in all it was a adventurous day trip. As it was raining heavily I wasn&apos;t able to take any pictures.",

		"Text": "Do you feel like going to a beach destination other than Goa? Do you want to just relax and have a slow life and don&apos;t want to party much and want to spend some alone time with your better half? Then you have opened the right article :)If you have lesser days, you can explore Pondicherry in 2 days, but if you have more days then sit back, relax, spend time with yourself and find the purpose of your life and other smallest things. From yoga, to meditation, to good food, to french architecture or just sitting by the beach side, you have all the means to make yourself happy.We started our journey from Chennai, so we rented a self drive car from Nisha cars. Pondicherry is 3 hours drive from Chennai, the roads are very good and it&apos;s a lovely drive. We stayed for 3 days at Club Mahindra Resort, it has a private beach and also some beach side cafes thus, shortlisted. Stay was good and the room/suites were very spacious and nice too. \nDay 1I have been to Pondicherry earlier as well, so the first place where I visited was White town. White town is basically the center of the city. All the good cafes, hotels are situated there. Also, you can spot some of the photo spots where the entire city is painted yellow and very nicely decorated. The nature also plays a part, you can see beautiful trees with colorful flowers blooming and making the place more beautiful and picture perfect. You can visit some of the best cafes there and also sit at the beach road. Recommended places are - Cafe de arts (Veg - only cash accepted), Bay by buddha - The promenade, Villa Shanti, and Coromandal cafe.The best thing about the Pondicherry beaches are that they are never too crowded and kept very very clean. The main beaches are Promenade (beachfront in the city and stretched over few kms, very similar to Marin drive in Mumbai), Paradise (can be reached by ferries, I didnt go because we were already at the private beach of Club Mahindra) and Auroville beach (also called as Auro beach).Day 2Next day we went to Auroville, it&apos;s a big township and has many well maintained gardens. It&apos;s a peaceful place, where the main moto is to unit the human. The main center here is Matramandir, but Matramandir is mainly for those seeking peace, concentration and harmony. Any person of any nationality can visit this place. Do visit Auroville bakery for some amazing food. Rest of day, we spent exploring some more places at White town and doing shopping. Authentic leather products can be bought from here.Day 3As today was the last day and we explored almost every nook and corner of the city, we decided to drive down to Pichavaram Mangrove forest. Pichavaram is close to 80kms from Pondicherry. Must carry - Odomos, sunscreen lotion and an umbrella (it may rain/to be safe from Sunburn as you will be on the boat for 3-4 hours). You can take a boat ride and visit inside the mangrove forest, it is close to 3-4 hours ride. The boatman can take you inside by charging little extra, which is worth paying, and at the end they halt for few minutes at a beautiful untouched beach, very peaceful and clean. After Sunderban, this is the second largest Mangrove forest in India. You can spot many migratory birds as well. The entire trip to Pichavaram will take your day, so by the end of the day you can sit and relax at the resort.Don&apos;t expect Pondicherry to be a party hub like Goa, it has it&apos;s own charm. If it&apos;s time for you to explore some history, adventure and in mood for some quieter and peaceful place, then it has to be Pondicherry.",

Had to bunk one week of school and Durga Puja but its the US, well, it needs some sacrifice.There wasn&#x2019;t any direct flight. We flew to New Delhi on the night of 30th September 2010 and had a connecting flight at 2 a.m. the next day to JFK Airport, New York.\nDay 1Washington D.C.HotelsMapDAY 1We reached JFK Airport on 1st October, 6.30 a.m. local time. We kept New York for a later date and headed to La Guardia Airport for the next leg of our journey. From La Guardia we headed to Washington D.C. followed by a two hour road trip to Richmond.Places Visited:New YorkManhattanLa GuardiaWashington D.C.RichmondWe were staying at a relative&#x2019;s place. It was getting too tiring now and on top of that Jet lag had bitten me very hard. On reaching there, I headed straight to my bed without bothering much to freshen up.DAY 3Day 3RichmondHotelsMapWe decided to see the city. We went to the Downtown area of Richmond, grabbed a bite at the Burger King, visited the Dollar Tree, where every item is priced at one dollar and a famous Jewelery Shop named Bachrach&#x2019;s.Dollar&amp;nbsp;Day 4Costco Pharmacy RichmondHotelsMapDAY 4We visited a Costco mall. This is basically a wholesaler place. But I wasn&#x2019;t really interested in shopping. Instead my attention was completely to the free food samples that were being offered. Usually people try to sell their homemade products like cookies, ice cream, fruit juices, chocolates, potato crisps etc here. They will even allow you to try a free sample. I had my lunch sorted from those free samples!Day 6Barnes &amp; NobleHotelsMapDAY 6Spent the morning and afternoon visiting malls. Evening was spent in leisure.Places Visited:WalmartTwin HickoryBook PeopleBarnes and NobleI bought the book, The Da Vinci Code from Barnes and Nobles. I was searching for the book for a long time but the book was out of print in India.Twin HickoryDay 7Virginia BeachHotelsMapDAY 7Virginia BeachHotelsMapDAY 7We went to the Virginia Beach. It was a 2 hours journey from Richmond. Had a great time by the beach with cousins. Dined at the McDonalds. Also evaded the eyes of the cops at every checkpoint since we were 9 people in a car, permissible limit being 7. It was fun when my uncle used to notify us about an approaching checkpoint and my brother and my little cousin sister started hiding underneath the luggage.ViDay 8Short Pump Town CenterHotelsMapDAY 8Visited the Short Pump Mall. Its an open roof mall and its so big that usually people take two full days to see the place. We did our best to cover some portions. I found a wishing well too. Made a wish too!Wishing WellDay 9Colonial Trail Elementary SchoolHotelsMapDAY 9I was stunned to see how cheap the electronic items are in the US! I wanted to have a laptop for a long time and it didn&#x2019;t take me much to convince dad to buy me one. But then, dad is a typical Indian. We visited three stores before finally deciding which one to buy. The laptop was available for USD 346 (INR 16,500 at that time), the same model was up for INR 64,000 back at India. And you know the first thing I did with my laptop? I opened a Facebook account!&#xA0;Places Visited:Crate &amp; BarrelColonial Trail Elementary SchoolDay 10WashingtonHotelsMapDAY 10.The next day we went to the capital, Washington D.C. Let me tell you that the traffic at Washington is no better than that of India.Places visited:The PentagonCapitol BuildingWashington MonumentThe White HouseUnited States Botanical GardenUnited States Anthropological MuseumThe best thing about the city is that there is no entry ticket for the museums. Now, D.C. was half visited. We planned to stay two more days here. Cab fares are extremely high and a distance of 1 mile can fetch as much as 10 dollars! Thanks to the waiting time in the traffic.Capitol&amp;nbsp;Day 11Washington D.C.HotelsMapDAY 11Places visited:Space Exploration CenterNational Museum of Natural HistoryDay 12Smithsonian National Air and Space MuseumHotelsMapDAY 12Places visited:Department of EnergyDepartment of AgricultureThe Smithsonian Institution is responsible for the maintenance of the museums of national importance. These buildings are so big that usually it takes one entire day to see every exhibit on display. We somehow managed two per day.Day 14Morris PlainsHotelsMapDAY 14We went to New Jersey after having one day break. We stayed at Morris Plains, a place famous for Grizzly Bears and Deer, which we got to know about later on though. It took us the entire day to travel to New Jersey and then to Morris Plains. Hence we decided to spend the day indoor only.Day 15Meena BazaarHotelsMapDAY 15We decided to explore the city the next day. We visited the local Bengali area. There was a supermarket run by Bengalis only named Mina Bazaar. We then visited a Gujarati community where there was a festival being celebrated. On our way back to Morris Plains, we made a quick visit to a T-Shirt Factory.Gujarati Samaj at New JerseyDay 16Staten IslandHotelsMapDAY 16Places visited:Times SquareLiberty IslandStatue of LibertyStatue of LibertyDay 17Times SquareHotelsMapDAY 17We loved Times Square so much that we wanted to have another look at the wonderful place! I don&#x2019;t think there is a single building at Time Square which isn&#x2019;t a skyscraper. You cannot see the sky, you look up and all you see is buildings.Day 18ManhattanHotelsMapDAY 18We went to Manhattan the next day. We took the NJ Transit instead of car to get a taste of the train journey. On our way back we went to the Rockefeller Center.Empire State BuildingDay 19MendhamHotelsMapDAY 19Halloween was just at the doors and the streets had started being decorated. We went to a place to see Halloween decorations called Christmas Tree Shops.Places visited:Dosa House, a place famous in NJ for huge dosas.HaridhamChurch of St. ChristopherDosa at Dosa HouseDay 20J.F.K.

We planned to halt for a day at New Delhi and came back to Kolkata on the 22nd.The trip lasted for over three weeks. The best trip I ever had at that time. However it lost its &#x2018;being the best&#x2019; status 6 years later to Singapore. But that&#x2019;s for some other day!",

With the summers approaching, what better place to spend a week than a perfect place as this!\nDay 1MG Marg MarketHotelsMapDAY 1There isn&#x2019;t a functioning airport at Gangtok yet. We traveled to Bagdogra Airport on 18th March 2018. From there you can easily get private cabs or shared vehicles to Gangtok. It is a four hour drive from Bagdogra Airport to Gangtok City. Like a friend suggested, the best place to stay at Gangtok is undoubtedly at M.G. Marg, the heart and business center of the city. Now, M.G. Marg, being the city&#x2019;s first eco-friendly area, doesn&#x2019;t allow vehicles to enter the place. Hence you gotta walk your way to the hotel. ????We reached our hotel at 8 o&#x2019;clock in the evening. It is advisable not to plan anything on the first day since the uphill drive takes a toll on your body. We spent the day at leisure, taking a stroll at M.G. Marg only, visiting some local shops.M.G.Day 2Tsongmo LakeHotelsMapDAY 2The next day we went to the Changu Lake, Remember that you need to apply for a permit to visit there and it is advisable to get it beforehand via your cab driver or travel agent. It is a two hour drive from Gangtok to Changu. Situated 12,400 feet above sea level, temperatures are mostly below the freezing point throughout the year and you can see snow even in the month of March! The lake was partially frozen when we visited. However you need not carry all your woolens. There are local shops near the lake which allows you to rent jackets, gloves and snow boots at 50 rupees per item per person. Yak rides at Changu is very famous, at the same time very expensive. A five to ten minute ride costs as much as 1,300 rupees.&#xA0;From there one can plan to visit the Nathu La Pass and Baba Mandir. Unfortunately the single road leading there was closed because of snowfall.Day 3GangtokHotelsMapDAY 3The next day we went for city tour. It usually takes 6-7 hours to cover all the major sight seeing places. Honestly speaking there isn&#x2019;t much to see in the city except one or two places.Places Visited:Ban Jhakri Waterfall.Gonjang Monastery.Tashi View Point.Lhasa Falls.Plant Restoration Centre.Ganesh Tok.Flower Exhibition Centre.Handloom and Handicrafts Exhibition.The two waterfalls which we saw didn&#x2019;t quite live up to the expectations. I have seen better. Tashi View Point was amazing! You get a 360 degree view of the city and a mesmerizing view of Mt. Kanchenjunga!Mount Kanchenjunga from Tashi View PointThe Plant Restoration Centre was quite good as well.You can also try paragliding at Gangtok. It costs 3,000 rupees a person for a 7 minute trip and you get to see the city from a bird&#x2019;s eye view!On our way back, we visited Kalimpong and Delo but that&#x2019;s for some other day!",

		"Text": "Mountains force you to contemplate about your existence among the larger scheme of things. The scale and grandeur of these almighty mountains always makes you wonder whether our superficial lives and our falsehood dominance over this world really matters among the raw nature. The sturdy trails and the rocky boulders challenge your will and courage to its optimal level and bring out the best in you. We are also devotees of Lord Shiva and determined to trek and hike all the Five Kailash of India. The toughest one is supposed to be Shrikhand Mahadev.  After searching the web and watching so many videos about Shrikhand Mahadev trek, me and my friend Neeraj decided to do this trek in the month of July as during this month the H.P Govt duly organised the trek as Shrikhand Mahadev Yatra for the devotees and pilgrims. As we all know religion and faith in India are inextricably entwined and it is a common belief in Hindu religion that completion of such hard treks of Kailash might lead you to the path where you can seek the blessings of the creator of this Universe- the almighty Lord Shiva. So devotees of lord Shiva from different parts of the country come here at this juncture and pay their obeisance to the great Lord Shiva by accomplishing the formidable task of reaching the summit of 17150 feet high mountain. People try to please Lord Shiva by offering Holy Ganga water and Bael Patra(Aegle marmelos) to the natural Shivling standing tall at the height of 5162 metres. After seeing the diversity among the pilgrims, one can easily presume that Faith knows no bounds and it cannot be defined with any reason and scientific logic in India.  As per the popular belief this is a place where Lord Shiva had emerged when the demon named Bashmasur was chasing him as he was being conferred the power by the great Shiva himself on the influence of which he could destroy anyone who comes under the area of his palm. As the Shivling is broken from the middle portion, it came to be known as Shri Khand which normally means broken in English. Taking a serious note of the toughness of this trek as generally described in various blogs and YouTube videos, we started to prepare early in the month of June for this trek. Every morning we do 2 km of running along with 4 km brisk walk alongwith situps and it was our only training programme to prepare for the trek which later proved a boon for us while traversing through each point of the trek. ROUTE MAP OF SHRIKHAND MAHADEV FROM JAON VILLAGE  DAY 1: CHANDIGARH TO SINGHAD VILLAGE (250 km) -By road to Jaon- Then 4 km to Singhad on foot.  We started our journey from Chandigarh with a pro trekking group called Trekking Cougars- DIY whose leader was Mr Jograj Singh, an experienced trekker who has done various tough treks in the past. We have hired an Innova for the journey and the group contains people belonging to different states who in spite of their busy schedules came this far to accomplish the daunting task of reaching the holy mountain standing 17150 feet high. Such is the magic of internet these days that it can connect you with everything and everyone which seems to be a happening thing or a place around this world. The only irony among these pro-trekkers is that they want to travel to these high altitudes to disconnect themselves from the world as per the assumption and when they reached there they are the ones who mostly crave for internet in these mountains. It is trendier now to tell others about your travel experience rather than be an silent observer of your journey. In an instant, pics of travel were posted into social networking sites to get the maximum likes and views. We travelled through lush green landscapes of Shimla, Fagu, Theog and Narkanda. Apart from the hubbub of people and tourists on these hill stations, we surprisingly found some mountains which are free from any human habitation and tourism facilities and the resulting scenic views really gripped our mind and soul. The beautiful verdant jungles created curiosity in us and we craved to unravel the mysteries hidden there as we all know that every mountain has a story to tell. When people in the low lying cities are vexed by the humid hot weathers we are the ones who felt the touch of cool winds on our faces and at that juncture it was an exhilarating experience and we felt privileged.  Near NARKANDA VALLEY One can easily figure out that why this belt of mountains is suitable for apple vegetation and you can also spot various cobwebs like covers in each farm on these mountains which are neatly placed over the apple trees in order to save them from the harsh rainy weather. One can easily persuade others with reasons that why Himachal is called the apple bowl of India. Some locals have told us that the majority of the apple production of this region is exported to foreign countries and we people only get the third grade apple supplied in our mandis. Also he told us that apple is the only fruit that can be consumed all throughout the year and even if these apple crops are rotten they can be utilised by the govt and other private factories in production of the famous byproduct named as apple cidar vinegar. Nice information we got there. We came to know that earlier people were also engaged in honey production but due to the ongoing rampant construction projects to promote tourism and the profitable gains in apple production,, farmers here have renounced apiculture. The abandoned beekeeping boxes lying near the roads can prove this point and it could give you an idea about the current scenario. Covers to save apple trees from rain  After 12 hours of weary travel, we reached Nirmand village at 6 pm where you can find various apple orchids in such an abundance that you can easily name this village as Apple Bowl Village. Apples and Apples everywhere. After half an hour of trundling through a narrow road , we reached Jaon village during dusk which is the last point of this journey travelled through road. After that you have to walk through a gravelled path which leads you to the village named as Singhad and it is also known as the base camp for this trek. Singhad is a very happening place during the Yatra as it was always swarmed with the devotees and pilgrims who continuously chants Om Navay Shivya and Jai Shankar to encourage the people. The melodious environment combined with the religious jagran instilled a sense of courage in us to complete this Yatra successfully and we felt very excited for the whole trip. Here you can spot locals alongwith some trekkers who seems to be very excited to do this Yatra in the first instance and some of them actively participate in the jagran which continued for the whole night. JAGRAN AT SINGHAD VILLAGE  We met some solo trekkers who came here just to explore the beauty of Himalayas and complete this trek which is supposed to be one of the toughest trek of India. It can be a great feat for them to enter this trek in their trekking biodatas. The pro-trekkers are equipped with expensive equipments- the nicest stuff you ever saw and top of the range cameras having tripods which helps them to capture every moment of their trek. All of them have the best trekking shoes available for this trail and they have stashed their rucksacks with all the required clothing in order to sustain in the cold and harsh environment they would face on the higher altitudes. They were busy in hiring the porters who can carry their equipments and their luggage with them so as to make this trek less tiresome and easy. It is beneficial to hire a porter as they know these mountains like no one else and they have done numerous trips every year up and down with huge loads carried on their backs. They were exploited to a great extent by the urban trekkers but their origins and harsh upbringing in these mountains is a blessing which makes them able to bear the weariness. Their bodies are naturally designed for these high mountains and they are less vulnerable to high altitude sickness(AMS) which has proved fatal to most of the urban pilgrims in the past years. Also, it is amazing to see the locals who without any equipment complete this tough Yatra in their slippers and basic clothing. The harsh environment of Himalayas really tests one stamina and strength which can only be endured by these locals from their utmost faith in lord shiva. Sometimes you can spot youngsters smoking sulfa to get a high as they believe it is a Prasad of lord shiva. I would not recommend it though due to the health hazards of smoking but you can&apos;t say anything here which opposes one belief and we let their sentiments prevail over health. There is a free langar service in singhad alongwith free basic sleeping facilities to rest in the night after such a long travel.  DAY 2:- SINGHAD VILLAGE TO KALI TOP (15 k.m.) Early morning from the singhad village all devotees chanted Om Namah Shivaay and started their Yatra from the tasty langar service comprising of aloo parantha and dal chole which provides you with some energy for the upcoming day. The path from the village carries you to the narrow way where a river is flowing by your side with such an enormous amount of flow that gives you fear in the first instance but then it makes you feel excited about the adventure you will face along the way. After walking through this path for 4 km you will reach Bharathi Nala where you can register yourself officially for this Yatra.  BARATHI NALA  After crossing the small bridge of Barathi Naala you can find a tent where you can buy some water bottles and one can have a Maggi and click some selfies to cool oneself down. From the locals this point is believed to be the starting point of this Yatra as the real trek starts from here which is also known as dandidhar a steep incline of 70-80 degree that can test your body and mind to the optimal level. It can challenge your strength and endurance to such a level that most of the pilgrims specially novices and unfit people lose their interest and courage to climb this steep ascent of mountain. A quote to remember there &quot; climb that goddamn mountain&quot; from Jack Kerouac and the quote hold our minds and we started ascending. The trek was so slippery that your wrong judgement can break your ankle and bone in a blink of an eye and your whole trip could be spoiled with pain and agony. It is a very dense forest and has a lot of vegetation comprising of deodar and sal trees. You can hear the chirping of birds which can make you feel like intruders which come in their homes to wander and search for the unknown. The trail is all about climbing climbing climbing.  STEEP ASCENT OF DANDIDHAR ON THE WAY TO THACHRU All your queries about the time left to reach the next point are met with lies by the locals who otherwise really want you to complete the trek. It&apos;s a long distance and the best way to complete it is keep walking at your own pace and having less stops. The large canopy of deodar forests deceive your eyes about the height you have gained and then suddenly through an wide opening you realise that you are really above the clouds where the view encompass the lush green landscape of Himalayan forests.  On THE WAY TO THACHRU  After so much weariness many unexperienced trekkers specially people wilting for lack of courage started descending. After toiling incessantly with our full strength and endurance we reached the first point of our journey named as Thachru. There are lots of tents and other arrangements for the pilgrims to have a night stay there. One can take a sigh of relief and quench his thirst and hunger from the tasty langar service of rice and daal kadi. We spent our time guzzling the food but ate sparingly as our digestive system is not accustomed to outside food for a long period. Hats off to the devotees who organised such langar services. With their help people can afford to complete this trek successfully. My friend Neeraj was obsessed to complete this dandidhar trail in one go and I also agreed with him as we did&apos;nt want to ascend on the next day with so much sweat and labor . TAKING HALT AT DANDIDHAR So we decided to reach kali top on the same day. Locals can reach singhad to bheemdwar in the first day very easily but we know our abilities and due to the loads of weight we carried in our backpacks it was really supposed to be an ardent task. After one hour from thachru the vegetation has changed to a great extent. The long deodar trees and thick vegetation was replaced by the green meadows and rocky terrain where one can see beautiful tiny flowers of different colours. Evidenlty, weather in these mountains changes very rapidly and it was same with us. The warm sunlight was gone and a light drizzle started pouring small droplets over us which shivered our body and chilled our bones. The beautiful scenic views were shrouded by the fog which has reduced the visibility to almost zero and it became quite impossible to see our next path in these mighty mountains but we walked and walked and suddenly found a group of people worshipping around a stone idol and suddenly we heaved a sigh of relief and came to know that it was Kali Top where we have to stay until tomorrow.  KALI TOP  After worshipping the idol of kali mata. we hired a tent for one day with complementary food facilities. It was a nice and cosy stay as the tent was meant for only two people and we manage to have our own privacy which is very rare to find on such stays .After leaving our stuff in our tent we came outside for a stroll and suddenly the weather became clear and we have the first darshan of shrikanth Kailash. I zoomed through my camera and saw people there and we both felt amazed about the level of reverence of these people who managed to reach there successfully at that nick of time when the last ray of sunshine is about to leave from the earth. That moment infused a deep respect in our minds and hearts for the great lord shiva and we Shouted loudly the magic words &quot; Har Har Mahadev&quot;  View from Kali Top Shrikhand Mahadev from Kali Top My friend Neeraj After a nice stroll and admiring the beautiful Himalayan landscape we had dinner and some discussions about our schedule for the next day. Thereafter, we slept like a hibernating beer. Our sleep was broken by a loud thunderstorm and suddenly it began to rain heavily. At that moment I began to think non sensical things and ominous thoughts which were mollified by the chants of Jai Bhole. DAY 3: KALI TOP TO BHEEM DWAR (8 km)  At early morning we packed our bags and started moving to our next stop i.e. Bheem Dwar. From kali top the distance was approximately 8 kms. Basically we were somehow relieved that we have covered the main steep ascent of dandidhar and now we have to only descent further to reach it. There was a slight drizzle which has created the ongoing path a slushy mixture of mud and rocks. It was a descent now but it was very scary because of the slippery nature of rocks which contains no point of friction for the feet to hold on between them. It seemed like we are descending on a ravine which has no clear path and you are completely relying on your rock climbing skills. We managed to reach the end point of that valley named as Bheem Talai. It also have the free langar service and we both took a halt there for some time and then started on our path. The water from the glaciar streams get collected here in a small cavity to form a small lake which is the speciality of this place. A nice place to click some pics as this region encompass the whole portion of verdant Himalayan landscape and you can easily capture them from all sides. After clicking some shots , we started moving towards our next stopping point.  Neeraj heading on the way  After trekking for one hour in undulating hills, our heavy bags started to take a toll on us and I felt very tired after climbing a steep hill. Suddenly a feeling of faintness came and I stopped at a point and asked my partner Neeraj to kindly take a halt somewhere. Unexpectedly, I got a strong urge to unbelt my rucksack and flip it down the hill so as to relieve the tension it was causing on my shoulders. We realised the importance of effective and minimal packing on such hard treks at that time and promised each other to comply with the rule books of trekking. Like a miracle , a small tent shop came and we decided to leave our unnecessary items like unused tshirts, data cables, extra pair of shoes in his shop so as to alleviate the weight of the bags. Thereafter, we carried on with the trail which is actually the trodden path made by the thousands of pilgrimages coming from far-away places every year in order to have the darshan of Shrikhand Mahadev. We crossed various undulating hills and the weariness caused due to continuous walking on the trek makes you lose track of how far you have come. Your eyes search for the next halt among the receding ascending slope and then descending slope and the circle goes on and on. On the way, we encountered various small streams which have made our shoes soggy which later proved very detrimental for our feet. The next place to reach was Kunsha Valley, a beautiful open grassland having few tents and surprisingly we found Diet coke cans. &#x2003;  KUNSHA VALLEY People there were busy munching snacks and gulping the coke cans in order to ensure their minds that they actually belong to the urban world and this is only a fleeting visit on these mountains. We clicked some pics there and you can spot some sheeps grazing there behind me in one of the pics through zooming a bit. During this season people trample on these mountains and the natural beauty is somehow destroyed to some extent but this gathering of pilgrims is for a short period of time and nature was invited back in these mountains after the Yatra which enable these mountains to retrieve their exotic beauty and charm. One of the streams was actually a glacier in the past.  Beautiful Landscape on the way to Bheemdwar  After trudging up and down for another two hours we reached a crest of a hill where colorful tents came slightly into view. We took a halt for fifteen minutes there and pondered about the distance we have covered on that day. The whole point of the trek is to get rid of the comfort zones of our homes and be the lonesome traveller for one week. We just succumbed to the panoramic view of that landscape which consists of various streams flowing from all sides on each mountain and gurgling sound it produced was the best sound I have ever heard during this trip. It was a fantastic view which cannot be expressed in words and ahead of us there was Bheem Dwar our last and next halting point. From Bheem Dwar you have to complete the final trek of 7 Kms to reach Shrikhand Mahadev. After completing such an ardent journey on such a hard trail on one day for 8 km, it was a quite a respectable distance for us. After hauling ourselves step by step we reached another halting point where youngsters were sitting on a huge boulder which stood right in the corner of a deep ravine. There were colourful tents all across the valley and here one can easily perceive the scenic view in front of him as the work of a painter who splattered different colours on his canvas. We have finally reached Bheem Dwar . This is the place where our final trek to Shrikhand Mahadev starts. We crossed some more undulating hills and reached the camp site where hundreds of tents were pitched to provide the night shelter to the ascending and descending pilgrims. We decided to take a halt at the last point among the series of tents as we wanted to minimize distance for the final summit the next day.  &#x2003; We met some men and bargained for our night stay. Our tent was just a small canopy of hard plastic sheets with some blankets for the night. We were so tired that after we untied the buckles of our bags we just laid down and slumped on to the floor and finally succumbed to deep slumber. After two hours of peaceful sleep we woke up and mesmerised by the view of the beautiful landscape around us from our tent. It was bliss to be a part of such a natural environment where you can witness numbers of waterfalls all around you cascading through each mountain from huge rocks and boulders. It was a heavenly experience for our eyes. The clouds hung in the air and it seemed like God is showering its blessings on us in the form of these waterfalls and the water itself was coming from the heaven. One cannot imagine the scale of the beauty we have observed at that juncture as it should require ones presence at that point at that place. I cannot define it now. We heard chants of Jai bhole from the pilgrims who were descending after having the darshan of Shrikanth Mahadev. Their relaxed faces were filled with deep sense of gratification as their desire to touch the feet of Shiva has been fulfilled after so much labor and physical pain. They were acting as guides to others and conversed with them about the ways and measures to be taken to reach the top .People like us were closely listening to them and convincing our hearts that we can climb the trail easily and safely. We decided to do some cleaning as our pants were fully covered in mud. We went towards the nearest of the gushing waterfall and cleaned our pants and other clothings. The water was so cold that it made our hands numb for two minutes. We managed to do some cleaning work.  View from Bheemdwar  Dog that followed people on the trail- P.C.-DIY  At the dusk we had our dinner and we slept early at 7:30 p.m. due to the weariness and the reason that we also have to wake up early at 4:00 a.m. in order to walk the distance from Bheem Dwar to Shrikhand Mahadev a to and fro journey so that we would reach at our camp before dusk. Rain started again and made things worse. Our tent was just a thick plastic sheet erected with the help of two wooden rods. It started soaking with water and tiny droplets from the roof of our tent started dripping on our blankets. We were so exhausted at that time that both of us showed no concern to it. Around 9 p.m. I felt a strong urge to pee as I was drinking quite enough water to prevent dehydration. The most daunting task in these kinds of camps is to find a hygienic place to attend your nature calls as the make-shift toilets installed there were used by all the people staying around these camps and our toilet was so disgustingly dirty that one could not bear the stench and cannot afford to stand near it. Moreover, it was always occupied with some person or other. I decided to find some other natural place to relieve myself which was far away from the camps so as to maintain the cleanliness meter. The rain started pouring heavily and I stumbled and slipped many times as I was in slippers. It was really intimidating but I managed to find a place to relieve myself. I am sharing this awkward incident just to let people know that in such kind of treks you have to shun your basic sense of hygiene and be prepared for such kind of situations which would otherwise seem embarrassing in the first instance. Ancient human skills and methods of living prevail over the rational ways when you trek in these Himalayas.  DAY 4: FINAL TREK TO SHRIKHAND MAHADEV- BHEEM DWAR TO PARVATI BAGH - NAIN SAROVAR- SHRIKHAND MAHADEV  We woke up early at 3:30 am and packed the necessary items into our small bags and then started our journey together with the DIY group as they were also camping above our tents. We met them in the evening and discussed about our journeys. The heavy downpour of the night has made the track ahead really slippery and muddy. The people who have gone ahead of us have lighted their torches and they appeared like fireflies roaming above the mountains in pure symmetry in zig zag shape. We came across the first gushing waterfall and it seemed impossible to cross it as the night showers have swelled the river to a great extent. We all managed to cross the stream meticulously and heaved a sigh of relief. But it was just the start. The rain called continuously on the trail made it really boggy and slick. It was a never ending cycle of rain which irritated us and tested our patience. The whole path became muddy in such a scale that you cannot escape it in any way. You have to trudge through it to reach to the top of the mountain where Parvati Bagh is situated. We were fully covered in mud as we knelt stumbled and trod to make our way. We reached Parvati Bag after two hours fully soaked and filthy. The main path is actually a zig zag shaped trail and for a moment it appeared to be a screen of handheld videogame. The main path was discarded by the pilgrims due to its slippery nature and the pilgrims started plodding on the vegetation one after another. &#x2003; PATH TO PARVATI BAGH  The path ahead to us has no vegetation and the trail becomes rocky and full of huge boulders. Some said it is a stretch of 2-3 kms and then we would reach Nain Sarovar. We started to feel the chilly air rushing from the mountains into our bodies and it made us shiver as we were completely wet from inside. All our clothings were wet and soggy. My lighter trekking shoes became heavier due to the water retained in them as we were continuously treading on the wet path. We came across a region where yellow and white flowers are lying everywhere but they were not in a blooming state. A voice came from behind me and we came to know that it is the most revered flower species in the Himalayas, the prominent BRAHMA KAMAL which only blooms in night. Both of us feel lucky to be an onlooker of this holy flower which we have seen earlier in Internet. We wanted to touch it. But a local warned us that it contains chemicals which can make you feel giddy and nauseatic. None of us wants to take that chance in that kind of situation. Also, he told us that it is a common belief among them that breaking the petals of BRAHMA KAMAL can call rain in these mountains. So we respect their beliefs and started our journey further..  Brahma Kamal &#x2003; After two hours of walking meticulously over the huge boulders we reached Nain Sarovar. It is a large glacial lake which was believed to be the tears of Maa Parvati who cried on her parting with Lord Shiva. People used to take a dip in its holy water and it is believed that the water of this glacial lake can cure eye problems. I was shivering with cold as rain has not stopped for a second but my friend Neeraj decided to take a dip in the holy waters of Nain Sarovar. When you immersed yourself in such frigid water you become more vulnerable to Hypothermia. But faith can conquer everything and he took a small bath there. Too much googling and browsing materials about AMS made me worrisome as I started to feel a twinge on my forehead. I discussed this with Neeraj and he convinced me that I was OK and requested me to have faith in the Almighty Lord Shiva. With a loud chant of Har Har Mahadev I started ascending.  WAY FROM NAIN SAROVAR &#x2003; &#x2003; The next and final four hours of the journey was such an arduous and strenuous exercise for the body that one can only fathom that why this is called the toughest trek of India. There were boulders all across the area and they were so slippery that our one wrong move could land us in hell. We meticulously started ascending and our every breath chanted Jai Bhole in order to fill our hearts with some courage so as to reach the final point. It was like a never ending journey of boulders and glaciers. The mountains were draped with so much fog that it was impossible to calculate the distance remaining for the summit. The pilgrims who have the darshan consoled us with the fact that a short distance was remaining to reach the summit but all of them were lying as we climbed one summit after another but the holy Shivling of Shrikhand Mahadev was out of sight. The process repeated continuously for two hours. It was really a daunting task and a challenge for us about how much our bodies can endure but we just clambered and trudged through the huge boulders and glaciers. At last, a point came when we saw huge rocks having some coded language embedded on it. We have reached Bheem Bhai- which is believed to be the place where Bheem from Mahabharta has written the accounts on these rocks. Amazing sight for the eyes. From there, an hour of steep ascent was the last trail to climb. &#x2003;  With JOGRAJ SINGH-DIY Leader &#x2003; After hauling ourselves for another one hour, we have a slight glimpse of Shrikhand Kailash which instilled a great sense of excitement in us and filled our hearts with reverence. All our pains and the physical toiling vanished in an instant and we increased our pace chanting Jai Bhole. We crossed another one km stretch of glacier and thereafter clambered through a steep ascent of boulders. We were mesmerised by the views and really admired the Shivling for five minutes silently standing, amazed at the grandeur of it and the reverence of people there. I offered Ganga Jal from Haridwar to the feet of the Shivling and paid my obeisance to the creator of this Universe. Jai Bhole. We were so proud to complete this trek and expressed our gratitude with folded hands to the almighty Lord Shiva.  &#x2003; HAR HAR MAHADEV- SHRIKHAND MAHADEV &#x2003; NEERAJ showing his exultation after completing the trek  We learned so many things from this trek and our hearts has been filled with deep and great respect for the Himalayas. In a way, we begin to admire the great power of woods and the colossal scale of these amazing Himalayas. The wilderness stashed in these large mountains needs preservation and conservation by us. We learned about patience, courage and determination while traversing through each point of this trek. We discovered these mountains that millions of people in India scarcely know exist. Our perception for these mountains has changed to a great extent and we really bow our heads to such magnificent summits existing in the Himalayas.Thats all Guys .. Hope you enjoyed reading my blog.

		"Text": "Day 1Kongthong a small village is located in east khasi hill distric in Meghalaya 60km to the south from Shillong in India is a must visit for its panoramic view, unique culture and virgin beauty. With no sign boards to guide you, lack of road connectivity (giving you offroading feels) it should take you approx 4 hr from Shillong to reach this place. Weather here is unpredictable one moment it is dry, sunny and other moment it is cloudy, you wouldn&apos;t realize it&#x2019;s raining until you&#x2019;ll be drenched.The village is also known as &#x201C;Whistling Village&#x201D; as every individual there has their unique caller tune. They call this tune &#x201C;Jingrwai Lawbei&#x201D; which means mother&#x2019;s love song. In Kongthong, when a child is born mother hums a tune for the child which is inspired by the nature especially birds. As the child grows this tune becomes his caller tune, and he is called by that tune.Jingrwai Lawbei plays like a secret code for everyone in this village which cannot be cheated. If a person is somewhere far which cannot be seen with eyes, this tune is used and the person understands that he is needed somewhere and responds. The person calling might have something to speak or need to come with them or they just want to know if someone is there or no. Nobody can respond on behalf of anybody.With a very practical theory that high frequency sound travel longer distance in less time, people of Kong thong have been following this culture since decades now.What&#x2019;s magical is there are more than 600 people in this village with unique tune and no written record of these tunes. When a person dies, the song dies. Nobody uses the same tune even after the death.Khasi religion believes in almighty with no particular idol worship. They are always in touch with nature. They believe god is unseen but he is there taking care of the world. They have extreme love and respect for nature.One more different practice of this village is earlier people here were uneducated so during those times if somebody purchased or sold their land it was difficult to keep a record of it. They used to follow a different system where in they used to erect a stone in the presence of members of village durbar and the parties selling and buying land. The stone would stand as evidence to both the families that the land is sold to a particular family and can&#x2019;t be taken back. They call it &#x2018;Mausakhi&#x2019; in khasi, mau means stone and sakhi means evidence.Apart from these practices, the village has a football pitch, a place for community gathering where they perform their pooja and cultural dance. Village has no hospital or police station but a dispensary and school until grade 8. The crime rate here is 0 making it safe to live here. People here are very simple, gentle, polite, warm and extremely hospitable.&#x201C;After seeing people appreciate the unique cultural practice we follow, it came to my mind how can I work in a city? Why not use the resources we have and let the world know about existence of such practices. People who want to know it will come and explore our village and experience our culture how we are living.&#x201D; - Mr Rothelle who was our guide has finished his graduation in commerce from North Eastern University but quit his promising career to promote tourism in his village. He is taking efforts to let the world know about their culture. Also they have build guest house for people who wish to stay and experience their culture.In the world where we don&#x2019;t have time for ourselves, where innovation and gadgets have made our life at finger tips there is still this village sticking to it routes, giving future a greener hope.Take days out of your busy city life visit this beautiful place, living there would give you experience which no other part in world would give you.",

		"Text": "Day 1It was a cloudy sunday morning. We decided it was a beautiful weather for a ride .. Quick tap online we found shivanasamudra was one of the places we did not visit and besides since its monsoon it was best time to visit.Just to give u a brief about the place :Shivanasamudra&#xA0;is a small city in the&#xA0;Chamarajanagara District&#xA0;of the state of&#xA0;Karnataka,&#xA0;India. It is situated on the banks of the river Kaveri, which forms here the boundary to the&#xA0;Mandya District, and is the location of one of the first&#xA0;hydro-electricpower stations&#xA0;in Asia, which was set up in 1902.The project was designed by Diwan Sheshadri Iyer.Courtesy :wikipedia.Approx 138 kms from bangalore lies two waterfalls that is unique and Mesmerizing.&#xA0; Gaganachukki and Barachukki falls are formed due to split that takes place by river Kaveri.We took the kanakpura route which luckily had good resturants on its way . Coz close to ganagachukki you dont find many places to eat . When we travelled we found loads of Karnataka Police Gaurding the way&#xA0; gaganachukki is less crowded and you have to park your bike in a dusty and muddy ground . Then walk approx one kilometer and series of steps will expose you to gushing water and nature at its beauty .. One can see it from far and enjoy the beauty ..

		"Text": "Keywords: Hitchhiking, Vikarabad - Anantagiri hills, View point, Kotipalli, Camping, KayakingIt was almost two years back Including Tripoto, I came to know about the concept of Hitchhiking through my guests from couch surfing whom I have hosted.With my basic knowledge and the tips for Hitchhiking I have learned from my couch surfing guests, I have finally set myself to hitchhike to forest area located about 75km from my residence at Lingampally Hyderabad.It was four in the morning, woke-up and got ready by 0500Hrs, along with me my 5lts cotton bag stuffed with 2buns + one biscuit pack + 1lts Aluminium water bottle(Decathlon) + Hat + Sunglasses + Scribbling book &amp; pen and 7 pocket Vest(Decathlon). I left my ATM card and carried Rs300(for worst condition) It was dawn, the street lights burning with night fuel, I started walking down the street, roaring sound from the heavy vehicle&#x2019;s, passenger&#x2019;s alighting from there travel buses, aroma from the road side tea stalls, walking all the way to reach the location. When choosing to Hitchhike make you are at a line of sight minimum by 20 to 25mts.As it was my first time hitchhiking I was so nerves in asking the lift, the clock was advancing still I am not attempting to ask for a &#x2018;Lift Pleaseeeeeee&#x2019;, as the dawn was cracking down all of a sudden I raised my left hand, closing all the fingers expect thumb finger showing up to the sky and weaving my hand resembling &#x2018;Lift Pleaseeeeeee&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s almost 45minutes past nobody was stopping, trust me I was almost in a state of mind that I would not get the lift that easy, though I looked decent professional traveller. Slowly a two wheeler wearing a helmet approached me saying were I need to go, my immediate answer to him Thank you... Thanks for stopping... I am on my way to anantagiri hills located at Vikarabad, he said me to get on and that&#x2019;s how my first lift of my trip started. I have changed a dozen plus two wheelers, five Vans and one 12-tier Lorry during the entire 167km circuit.It&#x2019;s around 1030hrs by the time I reached to my first destination Anantagiri hills. Irrespective of the religious beliefs, it&#x2019;s worth in visiting Anantha Padmanabha swamy temple, It&#x2019;s a very narrow entrance at a time only once person can pass through it. It&#x2019;s like as if you were entering into the cave, and that&#x2019;s were the articulated idols of the lord can be seen. From the inputs I have gathered from the local people I have hitchhiked to my next destination around 2 to 3km. It was a beautiful view point of the forest area and the small small village down to it. I had meet the forest guard introduced myself and further discussed with him. He was eager to know about my interest in doing so, I have brief him the way I travel meet the local peoples, know their cultures and tradition&#x2019;s. The forest was mostly populated with Deer&#x2019;s, Wild boars and birds says the forest guard. He understood my passion and informed me the vicinity places among them Kotipalli project is famous for camping and kayaking he added. As the time is stipulated for me I could not go to kotipalli project.Form here I hitchhiked through a Van to a small village named Kerelli, I could able to enjoy the beautiful landscapes, hilly roads, and the glimpses of the nature. While descending towards kerelli, I could see a group of B&#x2019;Twin bi-cycles lined up, they can be rented to cycle through the un-prohibited forest areas. I got down at Kerelli, from here I am supposed to go to Bugga another small village. I always wish to keep myself away from the tourist places and go to non-tourist places and be as close as possible to the nature.Waiting waiting waiting more that 45minutes as its very thinly populated I could not get the lift, though few lorries and cars were passing though me there didn&#x2019;t stop. On the other hand, its noon and sunny, then a fully loaded van appeared and driver slowed down and asked me where I need to go, I replied &#x2018;Bugga&#x2019;, he said to get in, during my entire trip he was peculiar driver, with darkish skin tone, dressed in a Kaki coloured kurtha pyjama, long beard, mouth fully stuffed with gutka, he further started discussion with me what I do etc etc. and fallowed by general conversation. It was small 30ft road approx. the van was wobbling, curvy, up &amp; down roads, 360 degrees&#x2019; agricultural fields, dense green hills, tiny villages, smoke coming from the small huts, as our conversation continued it took a turn to our current political affairs and the van drivers explains how it hampered their day to day life, we crossed Bugga and unknowingly looped back to Vikarabad.1400Hrs I reached to vikarabad sunny &amp; cloudy climate, en route to shankarpalli by palle velugu bus it was fully crowded, it was raining I had deep nab, from shankarpalii hitchhiked till Bhanur, the climate was hot, I am also tired, as entered into city I took local bus to patancheru and share auto to Lingampally. I have spent Rs59 in travelling 167Km. I have experimented my ability with the time I had there by adding Hitchhiking skill to my travel diary.

After longing for years, I finally visited Nandi hills last week along with my local friend in Bangalore.We planned to have this trip to be very budget-friendly one. Hence, we hopped onto the first KSRTC bus that started off at 8.30 am from Majestic to Nandi hills. It took two hours for us to reach the top. The ticket per head was Rs. 60/- and I recommend you to carry your own food supplies and water though you can still get to see shops at the top of the hill and beware that there are monkeys like everywhere. You, at times, would find monkeys more than people so be precautious about eating around in this place.I recommend you to wear good sports shoes and comfortable clothes if you are planning to cover all the tourist spots. All these spots are pretty near to each other and accessible by walk. This place is also famous to view the sunrise. For this, you need to start from Bangalore as early as 4.00 am. This place is best explored when you have your own vehicle.To make it one of the memorable trips, start early to view the sunrise and explore other places with your closed one(s).Keep travelling :)",

		"Text": "Ghats are for south what Mountains are for north. Undoubtedly Kerala is one of the most visited states due to its attraction ranging from the long beaches, backwaters to the western ghats and wildlife sanctuaries. One of such places is Thekkady and Gavi. Thekkady is also called Periyar and sometimes known as Kumily too.We took a road trip from Chennai to Thekkady and decided to travel at night so as to hit the Hills early morning. We covered distance of 570 Kms, making few stops on the way for dinner and couple of breaks for local tea. Most of the way is pretty much plains with approximate half an hour journey in the hills.\nDay 1ThekkadyHotelsMapIt was early hours of the morning and it was time to roll down the window of the car and feel the fresh air. We reached Thekkady by 5 in the morning and checked into our stay. We took a quick nap and were ready to explore after breakfast.The first spot was Periyar Tiger Reserve, for which we had already booked the tickets at KTDC website. We were at the gate of wild life sanctuary and found ourselves unlucky as due to some political rally there, the entry to the sanctuary&#x2019;s buses were blocked. The tickets are for fixed departures and due to the situation we were stuck in, we had missed our departure.Nevertheless, we somehow managed the entry into the main gate of the sanctuary. From there a small bus took us few kms inside the jungle to the Periyar Lake point. The sanctuary was so well maintained that it had almost the feel of a jungle. Beware of Langoors and Monkeys all around.Periyar LakeHotelsMapPeriyar Lake is so serene that one can sit somewhere and watch this beautiful landscape for hours. To our bad luck, we could not go boating in the lake but we spent some time by the lakeside and headed out of the sanctuary.Next we hired a jeep to explore a nearby place Sathram and for some off-roading. The ride to Sathram is not less than a dream world, and the landscape is a beautiful sight to behold with tea gardens spreading across and a tiny road running between them. We hit a small waterfall on the way and took a dip in it. At some points, it was top of the hill with grassland on both sides.Sathram View Point 3HotelsMapThe view from Sathram view point was worth every penny spent on the jeep ride. As far as we could see, there was a series of hills covered with fog and mist. We spent some time at the view point and again started for the sunset point. On the way we fetched some local beer bottles.The way to sunset point was a thrilling off-road experience with our jeep going into the dirt ways made between the tea plantations, at some points on the rocks and at times steep climbs on the hills. There was no roads clearly yet we reached a point where we were to experience an amazing sunset. We sat down with beer bottles and watched the sun going down behind a mountain turning the sky orange.We started back for the hotel, yet another thrill was pending. It was dark and our driver took us to a jungle route. The silence of the jungle with the only sound of Crickets and our jeep was amusing and exhilarating. We reached to our hotel had dinner and slept.For next day we had booked one day Gavi tour and the same jeep came to pick us up very early in the morning. Gavi is in the heart of the Periyar Tiger Reserve and is spread across more than 300 sq.kms. with rich flora and fauna and raw natural beauty.Day 2GaviHotelsMapFor Gavi, I would say journey is the destination. The road was leading through some authentic Kerala villages and on the way we stopped at a small tea shop. The fog was playing hide and seek with us and soon we reached at the gate of Gavi Sanctuary where we had to get the passes.We had entered into the jungle, the road was leading through the dense forest covered in fog with signage of elephants passing. Our driver cum guide was so adventurous, he was popping out of his driver seat whenever he spotted wildlife to show it to us. We were able to spot some wild buffalos, Samba dear, family of squirrels and some birds including kingfisher. Standing at the back side of the jeep and watching ourselves going into the dense forest was astonishing.Soon we reached a point where on both of the sides it was grassland and the forest had just vanished. It was a location straight out of some movie scene. We stayed there for a while, took some pictures and then moved ahead.Our jeep stopped at a dam built on Gavi Lake where we had a good breakfast and embarked on a small trek. Our guide gave us long shoes cover to wear as the area was full of leaches. This small trek gave us some beautiful views and lastly a very thick jungle from where we trekked back to the lake.It was time for boating in the lake and our guide took us to the waterfall forming the lake. On our request, our guide stopped at the waterfall for longer than usual giving us enough time to bathe. To my surprise, the water was chilled and crystal clear and it reminded me of the virgin waterfall we trekked to in Manali. We spent a good hour in the waterfall and came back. After having lunch, we started for our drive back to Thekkady.In the evening we went Kerala Martial Art show, it was authentic and thrilling. At night we celebrated birthday of Ankit, one of us, and spent the rest of the night listening to good music in our balcony while sipping beer.Next day, we were ready to say goodbye to the place but before that we decided to take an elephant ride. It was a good ride, going into a big backyard covered with coconut and banana trees.But at the end you are back to where you were, dressed up for another day at work with the difference that now you have some good memories and pictures of mesmerising beauty of nature in your mind which are enough to soothe you until your next expedition.",

Ltd. which is the leading tour operator of the state. He smiled and immediately suggested Bundi and The Hadoti Palace for my stay. Bundi is a three hours smooth drive from Jaipur.The Hadoti Palace is ideal forIf you would like to explore a new side of Rajasthan (read lush green rice paddy fields and gurgling waterfalls) then The Hadoti Palace is for you. For those individuals and families who are looking to stay in a royal setting and get a taste of Rajasthani heritage and culture, then too this property is what you are looking for.About the propertyThe imposing facade of The Hadoti Palace is tastefully done in greeko roman architecture. The royal family of Badnore own and manage this hotel. The family hails its history to Jaimalji (who fought against Akbar in the siege of the Chittorgarh fort) and to Mira Bai, the famous saint, poet and devotee of Lord Krishna. The Hadoti Palace is centrally located and accommodation options include 43 spacious rooms out of which 7 are suites. All the rooms have either a king size bed or twin beds, writing table and sofa.

I was nervous, yet excited.\nDay 1Hotel Kalinga AshokHotelsMapDay 1I had reached Bhubaneswar, the City of Temples on 28th January 2018. The journey was indeed a tiring one! I had reservations at Hotel Kalinga Ashok near Kalpana Square and headed straight to my hotel.All I could manage to see on the first day was the Odisha State Museum. It took me about two and a half hours to cover the entire place. The museum boasts of ancient sculptures, manuscripts and artifacts. The entire building has been divided into 11 sections like archaeology, natural history, paintings, ivory works, musical instruments etc.I spent the evening deciding my itinerary for the next two days. There was a lot to cover and I had very less time. Time for some serious planning.Odisha State MuseumDay 2PuriHotelsMapDay 2Places Visited:1. Konark Sun Temple2. Chandrabagha Beach3. Jagannath Puri Temple4. Puri Sea Beach5. Puri LighthouseHaving an early breakfast, I set out for Konark. The road trip was amazing. The car clocked 100 kmph on the highway with a picturesque view in front.The 800 year old Sun Temple is truly magnificent! Although the main temple has been closed in 1903, but whatever remains outside still manages to grab the attention of all the visitors!We offered our prayers at the Jagannath Temple and then headed towards the Puri Beach. What disappointed me is the commercialization that has crept into religion. One needs to deposit the shoes at one place and the cell phones at a different place and hence one has to shell out money twice. The flowers and sweets to be offered are at a surged price, so are the monetary demand of the priests! And you need to provide a good donation to receive the main priests&#x2019; blessing. Not to mention, the fees for car parking as well.Konark Sun TDay 3BhubaneswarHotelsMapDay 3The third and the final day was very hectic. I had booked a reservation for the city tour along with adjoining areas through OTDC. The package comes for as cheap as 320 rupees and takes you through all the visit-worthy places in and around Bhubaneswar.Places Visited:1. NandanKanan Zoo2. Udaygiri and Khandagiri Caves3. Museum4. Dhauli Shanti Stupa5. Lingaraja Temple6. Mukteshwara Temple7. Kedar Gouri Temple8. Rajarani TempleThe journey started at 9 am; NandanKanan being our first stop. The Zoological Garden is spread across 1,200 acres of land and boasts of animals such as tigers, lions, elephants, zebras, bear, gaurs, crocodiles etc.From there we went to the Udaygiri Caves. The caves are from ancient times which dserves as a dwelling for the tribal people back at that time. Scenes from their daily lives are depicted on the walls beautifully.The Lingaraja Temple is said to be one of the fewest places where one can find Vishnu and Shiva at the same place. The Lingaraja Temple basically is a garden of temples housing a few hundreds of other temples dedicated to various Hindu gods and goddesses.We came back at 6.30 in the evening after having finished visiting all the places. On 31st January, I had my bus back to Kolkata.Nandan While this trip has been very exciting, there are certain things which demanded my presence of mind. There are quite a few things I would like to suggest to first time solo travelers:Always carry enough cash. There are various expenses that happens, apart from your planned expenses. Its necessary you set out from your hotel carrying enough money to come back to your hotel.Learn to speak a little bit of the local language. For example, if you want to ask the auto driver or the cab driver to go to a place, ask it in their language. It gives them the feeling that you are a local. If they sense you to be a foreigner to the place, they will demand a high fare.Having said all these, solo trips can be really exciting. But you are responsible for your actions. While there&#x2019;s fun and thrill, there&#x2019;s a risk of getting lost also. Always carry a map of the place you are visiting and while visiting a place, remember the way you came in so that you can trace it back. And if possible, inform somebody about your whereabouts.",

Though the airport is very small, there was a huge crowd. Thankfully I didn&#x2019;t have to face a crowd in any other point in my trip.\nDay 1Circuit HouseHotelsMapDAY 1I had checked in into the New Circuit House at Haddo Area. It was no where near the beach. Rent for a Non A/C room was INR 500 per person. I already had my breakfast on flight so I quickly freshened up and headed out to explore what this island had in store for me.Places Visited: Andaman Water Sports Complex.Tsunami Memorial.Ross Island.Andaman View Point.Corbyn&#x2019;s Cove Beach.Andaman View PointDay 2Mount Harriet National ParkHotelsMapDAY 2The Circuit House had no Wi-Fi connection. Data Connectivity in Port Blair sucks. Plus the food at the hotel at the Circuit House wasn&#x2019;t good enough. I shifted to another place close to the beach. Hotel Palika Place. Rent was high; INR 2,250 for a single bed Non A/C Room.

But the catch was that it was limited to the lobby only and that too, very slow! It was just good enough to let my mom know about my whereabouts over WhatsApp. Intense praying sessions helped to upload photos on Facebook, a single picture taking almost 15 minutes!Places Visited:Havelock Island.Kalapather Beach.Radhanagar Beach.Not much people know about Kalapather Beach, but I loved the beach! The different shades in color of the sea with the white sands made it a spectacular sight! However I failed to find what all the craze about the Radhanagar Beach is all about!Kalapather BeachDay 4Port BlairHotelsMapDAY 4I spent the day touring the city and buying souvenirs. Came back early in the evening because I had to pack my bags. Had an early morning flight to catch the next day.Places Visited:Cellular Jail.Zonal Anthropological Museum.Aberdeen Market.Light and Sound Show.Do note that photography is prohibited inside the anthropological museum. Cellular Jail charges extra bucks for photography.Cellular JailThe trip was truly an amazing one! I had made a fun with a local guy who actually guided me throughout the stay. Eateries are decently priced and you get all types of cuisines at Port Blair. Choices are limited outside the capital though. No other connections except BSNL works there. The place is truly beautiful. Not much places in India can boast offering hills as well as sea beaches in the same city!",

		"Text": "It had been on my mind to go on a trek/hiking trip for some time now. So instead of going to some place &apos;nice&apos;, roaming around in rented vehicles, do sightseeing [do nothing &amp; just relax], we decided to have an actual adventure trip where we would be put out of our comfort zones. Although we had trekked to a few forts close to Pune, the ones in the Himalayan region are more demanding and so we decided to go for a beginner&apos;s trek. Amongst the ones for easy-moderate level difficulty are the ones to Hampta Pass, Beaskund, Parashar Lake, Kedarkanth,Chopta etc of which we chose the one to Chopta-Tungnath-Chandrashila. It offers a good 4 day trek which includes hiking from the serene village of Sari to Chopta and a trek to the height of close to 13000 feet, which provided a sufficient condition for us to go ahead for the same.The one to Chopta-Tungnath is an all year round trek (except monsoon), although it is more picturesque in the winter with the snowfall. It is actually considered as one of the easiest treks in the Garwal region of the Himalayas.Day 1: The journey for Chopta Tungnath trek starts from Sari village, which is a 6-7 hours drive from Haridwar. We left for Sari at around 9 am from Haridwar. Sari lies between Ukhimath and Chopta, near Deoria Tal. The height of Sari is around 6500 feet. This is also the base camp for Deoria Tal. Also you will not find any ATMs or much amenities here. It is better to get those while travelling to Sari. Sari gives us a scenic view of many of the mountain peaks. We reached Sari at around 6:30 in the evening and decided to climb to Deoria Tal the same day, or rather night. Deoria Tal is around 3 km from Sari. The trek took us around 2 hours to reach to there( which was a bit more than required); to our defense, it was pitch dark around. On reaching the base camp @ Deoria Tal, we retired for the day.Day 2: Day 2 began early. Deoria Tal is at a height of close to 7800 ft. The mountain peaks of Chaukhamba, Nilkantha, Bandarpunch, Kedar Range, and Kalanag are visible from here. The only word that comes to mind at this place is serenity. One can see the reflection of the majestic &apos;Chaukhamba&apos; in the crystal clear waters of the lake. The &apos;Tal&apos; or lake is surrounded by woods around. One can go around the campsite and explore the trails around. Also there&apos;s a watch tower close to the lake that gives you grand views of the surrounding mountains. There are a few mythological stories that go around this lake, one of them being that the gods bathed in this lake. One of the facts shared by our guide was that the depth of this lake has not been measured till date. Having our breakfast, we started our journey towards Chopta -India&apos;s very own Switzerland.The distance from Deoria Tal to Chopta is of 14 kms which takes around 7-8 hours. We traverse from an altitude of7,841 ft (2,390 m) to 8,790 ft (2,679 m) in this trek. The route covers all the aspects of a nature hike. The route to Chopta covers ascents and descents, 20-30 min each so better to carry enough water [and some protein bars]. Also the trek gradient is moderate. The forest trail is full of rhododendron and maple trees, with the Kedar and Chaukhamba peaks visible every now and then. Along the trail you will reach a small meadow Rohini Bugyal, from where the Kala parvat is visible. As we go along, the trail takes us to Akash Kamini, a small river coming from Chandrashila. You can have lunch here and have your bottles refilled. The water is cold here, and so is the wind. From here the trail ascends gradually. After crossing a small meadow, the forest trail leads onto a road ahead. From here the Chopta base is a km away.We reached Chopta village at around 4:30 in the evening. You can find small restaurants and eateries around, with some of them offering a dorm service as well.Day 3: It is advisable to start the trek for Tungnath-Chandrashila as early as possible, so that one can capture the beautiful Sunrise over Tungnath and Chandrashila peak. We ascend from 8800 ft at Chopta to 12000 ft while climbing to Tungnath, while Chandrashila requires another steep climb of about an hour from the Tungnath Temple. Chandrashila is @ an altitude of 13400 ft. It is advisable to first climb to Chandrashila and then visit the temple on the return journey.Tungnath temple is the third of the Panch Kedars and the highest Shiva Temple in the world. There are many legends associated with this temple from the Mahabharata. The views on your left while climbing to Tungnath are incredible. It is advisable to carry water as there are no sources around the trek. Once you reach the base of temple, there are a couple of shops which offer tea and snacks.The climb from Tungnath to Chandrashila is close 800 ft ascent and is a very steep climb. The climb up to the summit takes about 45-60 minutes from the temple. Once you reach the summit, you get a 360 degree view of the mountains of Garhwal and Kumaon. For someone with an eye for photography, Chandrashila summit provides a beautiful landscape. This peak provides breathtaking views of the Himalayas, including Nandadevi, Trisul, Kedar Peak, Bandarpunch and Chaukhamba peaks.The total trek distance is around 8-9 kms from Chopta to the Chandrashila peak and takes about 4-5 hours.Having completed our &apos;beginner&apos;s trek&apos; by the third day, we had another 3 days at our disposal. Applying all the possible permutations-combinations of time, money and energy, we decided to further our journey to Badrinath and then return to Haridwar covering Rudraprayag ,Devprayag and Rishikesh on our way back.Day 4: The distance from Chopta to Badrinath is about 180 kms and takes around 6-7 hours via cab.We left for Badrinath in the wee hours of the day and our efficient cab driver ensured that we reached our destination by noon. En route Badrinath, you can visit Joshimath as well. Joshimath is one of the four monastries established by Adi Shankara. It is also a gateway to several Himalayan mountain climbing expeditions.Badrinath is a holy town and one of the &apos;Char Dhams&apos; of Hindu pilgrimage. You can find many options for accommodation with Dharamshalas and small hotels ranging from Rs 500/night to 3000/night. Alongwith the temple, there are few places close to Badrinath that are tourist attractions as well. First (and last) of them being the Mana village.Mana Village - About 3 kms away, Mana is the last village before the Mana Pass.It is 24 kilometres from the border of India and Tibet. There are shared cabs available, alongwith a guide to tour the village. It takes about 20 minutes to reach there. In the village, there are two caves namely &quot;Vyas Gufa&quot; and &quot;Ganesh Gufa&quot;. As per legend, it is believed that Maharshi Vyas composed and dictated the epic Mahabharata from this place. Both caves have the respective deities. Going further, we get to see the Saraswati river ,the Bhim Pul and the Saraswati temple.Legend states that Saraswati was making too much noise with its gurgling flow and it was disturbing Vyasa to focus on Mahabharata, so he cursed her to disappear from Mana. Hence she disappeared. Saraswati originates out of a rock and glides through the rocks down to join Alakananda river after 100-150 mts.Further we can see that there are two rocks forming a kind of bridge. Legend goes that when Pandavas were walking towards Swargarohan(pathway to heaven), Draupadi could not cross the river. Then Bhima lifted and placed a rock to create a bridge for Draupadi to walk. It is called as Bhima&apos;s bridge(Bhim pul). There are markings on the rock indicating Bhima&apos;s fingerprints. Going further the Saraswati temple is the route for Satopanth Lake trek.Post the sightseeing and having tea at the &quot; Bharat ki aakhri chai ki dukan &quot;, we returned to Badrinath to get into the queue for Darshan, which roughly takes around 3-4 hours.Day 5: We started for our return journey to Haridwar planning to cover Devprayag, Rudraprayag and Rishikesh en route. First in the line is Rudraprayag, which is about 160 km from Badrinath. There are two options available to reach Rudraprayag - state transport buses and private cabs. The buses start as early as 4:30 in the morning. Seats are filled mostly on first come first served basis. The bus ticket costs around 250 bucks, while the private cab may cost around 7k-8k. We decided to take the economic route with the state transport bus[ which made sure we were uncomfortable throughout the journey in every sense of the word].We reached Rudraprayag by noon. Rudraprayag is one of the Panch Prayag (five confluences) of Alaknanda River,the point of confluence of rivers Alaknanda and Mandakini. There are a few temples located in nearby locality to visit.After our &quot;pain-in-the-back&quot; experience with the state transport buses, we decided to take a cab to reach Devprayag. This is another one of the Panch Prayag (five confluences) of Alaknanda River where Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers meet and take the name Ganga. On a terrace in the upper part of the village is the temple of Raghunathji, built of huge stones. Other than Sangam(confluence) and Raghunath Ji Temple in Devprayag, one can visit sacred places like Mata Bhuvneshwari temple at nearby village Pundal followed by Dhaneshwar Mahadev temple, Danda Naggaraja (Lord of Snakes) temple and Chandrabadni temple. It takes around 3 hours to reach Haridwar from here, which left us with little time to cover Rishikesh.Day 6: Haridwar is regarded as one of the seven holiest places (Sapta Puri) to Hindus. Tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the river Ganga to wash away their sins. Brahma Kund is located at Har ki Pauri (literally, &quot;footsteps of the Lord&quot;) and is considered to be the most sacred ghat of Haridwar. We visited the Brahma Kund taking the holy dip in Ganga, marking the end of our journey.Trip takeaways:This trek has all the perfect ingredients for a beginner&apos;s trek. To begin with, it has one of the most beautiful forest trails There are sections with thick wooded trees, there are moss-covered trails through enveloping tunnels and there are trails that weave through clearings in the jungles.As one climbs up to Chandrashila, all the major summits of Uttarakhand pop into view. These are the tallest ones in India. Standing on top of Chandrashila summit is a blessing.Always ensure to carry enough water and some snacks around.If you plan well and finish off the trek sites in time, there are multiple tourist spots around to cover in your itineraryTrip Summary:Day 1: Reach Sari; 7-8 hours drive from Haridwar.Day 2: Sari (6,601 ft) to Deoriatal (7,841 ft); 2 hours, 3 kmDay 3: Deoriatal (7,841 ft) to Chopta (8,790 ft) via Rohini Bugyal; 14 km, 7-8 hoursDay 4: Chopta (8,790 ft) to Tungnath and Chandrashila (12,083 ft) and back to Chopta; 5 hoursDay 5: Drive from Chopta to Haridwar.",

		"Text": "Day 1Gokarna is my goto place if you wants to spend a weekend on a beach with a chilled beer . We started from Bangalore on 3rd of August at around 10:00 PM in Sugama non ac sleeper bus which cost at 700rs per head booked from redbus.com. Overnight journey from Bangalore to Gokarna Which take around 10 hours, we reached at around 8 AM in the morning. We directly went to Kudle beach and decided to stay at little paradise shack which costs Rs1000 per shack.In this visit to Gokarna we had decided to cover all the beaches from Kudle beach to Gods own beach by trekking through them all. One should carry as much as water with them as after OM beach there aren&apos;t&#xA0; any shacks or eatery.1) Om Beach, GokarnaWe started our trek from Kudle to Om beach at around 11 in the morning. Trek to Om is fairly simple and trail is quite easy to spot. Being monsoon season, August is an off season so not many people are visiting here . Beaches are not at all crowded and one can freely enjoy the beaches. But due to heavy tides it wasn&apos;t allowed to go deep into water . We stayed here for brief&#xA0; 30 mins and continued to our next destination.2) Half Moon Beach,Trek from Om beach to half moon beach is very picturesque , trek trail is easy to find but bit difficult. This beach trek is by far is the best one, trekking along the sea side with views to die for. One can only reach half moon either by trekking through the mountain or by taking a boat from Om beach.When we reached Half moon beach to our surprise we were the only one there and we had whole beach to ourselves. We spent an hour or so on this beach and then headed to Hell&apos;s beach.3) Hell&apos;s cliffTrek from here gets tricky one wrong trail and you will wander in the jungle for long, that&apos;s what happened with us. We missed the starting trail and took the wrong one which resulted in an hour of wandering into the woods. We tried to find the right trail but had no success, trek was difficult then the previous one&apos;s and sucked all the strength from us,we ran out of water and lost any hope of reaching hell&apos;s cliff and paradise beach. We finally found the right trail for&#xA0; hell&apos;s cliff and started the trek. Trek to hell&apos;s cliff is very difficult but view from the trek was beautiful. We again lost the trail and got lost . It is advised to follow Google maps but not fully depended on it. We somehow managed to reach hell&apos;s Cliff and made our own way as we clearly had no idea of the actual trail. 4) Paradise BeachWe were lost in the woods and had no idea of any trail which could lead us to paradise beach and we had to create our own trail to reach there. We reached paradise beach , one can camp here and spend the night. No shack is available here on Paradise Beach but for God&apos;s sack we got drinking water that was supplied for crops by local which gave us the strength to continue further. After spending time here on this beach we started for our final destination for the day i.e. Belakan beach or Gods own beach.5) Belekan beach/God&apos;s own beachTrek to Belakan beach is simple but a long one and we had already lost all our strength by this time and for our misery it started raining heavily. We reached Belakan beach at around 5:30 in the evening after 6 hours of trekking through all .We rested here for a while and had the best tea in all over Gokarna by a small stall called &quot;paradise cafe&quot;. To all who wants to trek through the beaches keep ample water for yourself. Keep your eyes open as you wouldn&apos;t want to miss the best view and as well as&#xA0; the trail as both would result in heavy damage :DAfter having tea and delicious Maggie ,we reached back to our shack on kudle beach by auto.We spent the night under the stars and listing to the sound of&#xA0; waves hitting the shores.God&#x27;s own beachHalf moon beach trekParadise beachHalf moon beachGokarnaSea gems,kudle beachOm beachKudle beachDay 2We didn&apos;t slept all night . Our itinerary for 2nd day was to visit the Murudeshwara temple. We took&#xA0; ksrtc bus from Gokarna bus stand to Murudeshwara temple at 6:30 AM. if you miss this one you have to take a bus to Kumta and then from Kumta to Murudeshwara . One side ticket will cost around 83/- per head from Gokarna to Murudeshwara temple. The gigantic statue of Lord shiva is a beauty to behold and the architecture of Murudeshwara temple is a work of craftsmanship. So detailed architecture consist of big statues make this place a must visit.We then came back to kudle beach and enjoyed the beauty of this beach.&#xA0; Due to rainy season all the water sports were shut down. We bid adieu to Gokarna and started back at around 8 PM towards Bangalore. This wasn&apos;t my last visit as I have plans to visit this beautiful city again,as and when I can. One can never be bored of this place, at least not me.Murudeshwara BeachMurudeshwara Murudeshwara templeMurudeshwara temple",

Paid for the ticket and waited around for my slot 18. Took around 30 minutes, slot 17 were 3 girls so I had an opportunity to be clubbed with them. Rappelling was fun entering the caves and sooner a batch of 10 people assembled towards the caves. Entered into the caves which was slushy, muddy and slippery, got accompanied with 3 Singapore girls and a couple from Thailand. People around me were very surprised to see me alone driving all the way Jogya city center and doing these alone. Post the slippery climbs, witnessed the sun rays coming from another cave hole which can be seen only from 11.00 to 12.30. Constant babbling would prompt to search for the stream, as its pitch dark one will not blessed. The spot where the rays are seen is mesmerizing and covered by limestones. Though I was enjoying the moments my mobile drained out of charge and mind was enforcing a camera for my next travel. We were sent in batches to the final spot and all of us emerged in taking pictures in different angles and poses. While returning the Thailand couple hand holded me in the places i slipped by, came back with the same rappelling way in a reverse. Dress was completely muddy and washed it off to ensure am clean and the dogs don&apos;t chase me. They had preserved a veg meal, had plain rice, fried tofu and tampei(seaweeds) a fulfilling meal after fast.Returned via the same route and a bit faster, enroute found the signboard for Prambanan temple and took the route.It was another 10 kms to reach to prambanan temple, got the tickets as a single entry as i did not carry enough cash or credit card with me, couldn&apos;t buy the combination ticket. Halfheartedly bought the single entry &amp; It was crowded when I first climbed saw lord vinayagar with a smile. The complete view of gopurams is a wonderful sight, but it was more wonderful towards the exit. Amazing architecture but the hot and humid wouldnt spare you enough time to enjoy the moments. Reached the hostel in the evening hours and opposite to hostel the vendors sell donuts and some fried tampei, tofu, banana. Had a sumptuous dinner with papaya, made the settlement to the hostel and packed up all stuffs for the next day.The transjogya is very close by hostel, pick the line 2A bus. Sun broke early the day and the roads were empty &amp; people were busy going to Namaz, the bus station are elevated ones which you need to enter from left side to claim your tickets.Yogyakarta to Jombor - Take line 2A bus which takes around 30 min,Jombor to Borubudur - cross the lanes and take the bus to borubudur, takes around 1 hoursFrom the bus station walk for another 10 minutes to reach the entrance. Bought the tickets and now that am hungry, ate my cream bun and guava juice to kick start the temple tour. Crowded with students, walked around and amazed with the architecture and carvings, while you keep climbing each floor depicts several carvings, there are several which will capture your eyes and fulfill the art desires. This was constructed during 875 AD and simply amazing with the talent &amp; knowledge behind. If these eminent person are still alive, they can put us for shame straightly.Tips: Hot and humid will make to sweat like pig, carry enough water &amp; cap.Buy the combination ticket for prambanan templeAs there are no direct buses, took a detour &amp; found a girl who talk in English and helped me to take the best route.Borubudur to Magalang - 1 hourMagalang - wonosobu - 2 hoursWonsobu to wonosobu main station - 5 minutesWonsobu main station - diang - 4 hoursAs soon as I entered wonosobu the temperature dropped and the buses were very slow, the moment was nearing diang it was greeny and routes were simply amazing, was seated next to the driver had some fun watching the roads. The driver was smoking and blowing towards me, requested him not to do that &amp; thankfully he was nice. Reached the hostel and refreshed, took a scooter from the receptionist and realized there were no petrol, post returning was walking around the whole area.Found the tampei hot fried, hot and tasty fulfilled my tummy, shopped some food rations for next 2 days in the super market and walking around. Entered Arjuna temple and found such beautiful places, enjoying the greenish with cold coffee and snacking around. While it was getting dark, returned to the hostel &amp; places are deserted by 6. PM. Female dorm was empty &amp; acquired it entirely, was writing the blog, slept early as there was a sunrise planned next day. Though i have from recovered from nausea, still unable to get accommodate the stinky Indonesia rice/noodles. Have been banking whole day on the bread, banana, juice and buns &amp; some hot fried stuffs.Woke up early at 3.30 &amp; was ready on dot by 4.0. There was another couple who joined me. The driver picked up and dropped us at the base, which took around 15 minutes. As i missed my light, banked on them for light, was quite a climb in pitch dark with steps. Last minutes another guy helped me to reach the spot as they lagged behind. While walking could witness millions of stars. The sun had some special guest of 100 plus me waiting with flash light and got seated towards the NE direction. Post the wait, at 5.10 sky started lighting and then turned cloudy, fraction of second had a glimpse of the volcanoes which was standing and it took a while for me realize with sleep eyes. Mt Batur vanished within seconds and at 5.20 sun played the same game and wondering if the sun would ever come out today. With a bit of disappointment people started moving and i was still holding the hope. At 5.40 the sky was clear and with the full view of Mt Batur came to my vision. The fumes were coming out for volcano, post the enjoyment and clicked several pictures of diang theatre which is of layered vegetation. Started moving down and had a slip and fell down straight on my tummy with several scratches. At that moment i was thinking something negative which universe slapped me hard which made me fall which evaded those thoughts. As it was hurting badly all i was worried is how am i going to carry my 14kg humpy and bumpy? It shall be taken care!Next visit was Batu Pandang from where you can view the 2 lakes Telaga Warna Lake, left hand side the lake is composed of high sulphuric acid which changes the color during bright sunlight and the right is the normal mirror lake. No one was around that area, so the lady nearby me accompanied me so that i can get some pictures clicked, with the local talk she was saying that not everyone is lucky to see the colors and so i am. She had seen red, blue and so many :(Post that was the skidang crater, it was fascinating with the pungent smell and had a feeling of entering the chemistry lab. Was mysterious to see the bubbles and the fumes which was emerging from the ground, was careful about my new expensive boots. Was standing near the crater &amp; merely awed at the greenish water bubbling with spewing fumes. Volcanoes are mysterious always, after all the mystification, reached the hotel, packed all the stuffs, rested for 30 minutes and was ready for next destination.Tips: if you are allergic buy a mask as it definitely burns the nose.Take the same route to wonsobu, on the way there were 2 ladies in the bus helped me with next destination route who could talk a good English. There were several routes which they suggested &amp; picked 2Option 1; reach semarang and take bus or trainOption 2; there are some direct buses to Surabaya from wonosobu, got the bus booked while i reached at 12.30, it was raining and the bus agent had some shelter where i was a refuge for the rest part of the day. Finally had the guts to explore the food and got noodles an egg omelet after several retrospection as lunch and was resting near by the bus. The bus was at 4.0 PM which relatively late for an hour.As Mt jien was closed and with the lengthy travel decided to pick up a flight from surabaya to DPS. While i was hunting my time, the bus agent helped me to get the tickets done through his laptop. Now the turn of the agent having some fun playing Indian hindi songs and while before i left, played humma and humma and he bloated the sound all through that area. With that note they were bidding a smiling bye with the song in the back ground.As the bus arrived, it was damn cold and was struggling to sleep, at 12.10 the bus stopped for dinner and they served rice, egg curry, chips &amp; tea had it without any curry. The bus again started and reached around 5.0 am.How to reach Probolingo from SurabayaFrom Surabaya terminal take bus at line 6, takes around 2 hours to reach Probolingo.The bus started at 5.30 and reached around 7.30. Walk outside the terminal and can find the Mt bromo bus. If you are with a heavy back pack, people will route you without asking. Found the bus to Mt bromo and the green bus will start only when it&apos;s full. The driver was trying to rib off money from me for a private ride, though i waited for 45 minutes. There is a concept of scooter taxi and many people offered and was dubious to take. Later decided to take one and with the maps on, reached the village in 1 hour. The check in time was around 2.0 pm and as it was full and had to find another homestay.Refreshed had bread and cheese and slept till 2.0 PM. while i woke up at it was completely foggy, was trying to go around check the plan for next day. Managed to get cup noodles and eat as lunch. My bad memory of missing the lights played a toll, definitely for sun rise i need a light. Couldn&apos;t find in any shops which i asked for and the village shuts down at 6.0 PM. as i was talking to a local, he took his scooter and went ahead and bought a torch light for me. Was very thankful to him and started to pack for early morning stuffs and sleep it off. Spent the day sleeping and reading books after tiresome travelling. As i was alone in the homestay, though the camera was fixed, it was scary, somehow i indulged in reading books and overcoming the fear &amp; slept earlyGot up early at 2.30 with a weird dream, now is this a vacation huh? I have been waking up early almost every day, sleep &amp; food deprived.hmmm! Refreshed quickly and started to the sunrise spot, wasn&apos;t that cold still carried the jacket and the warmers. It was pitch dark and could only see a blanket of stars spread across, while i was walking someone offered me a scooty ride and trying to negotiate the price, was not in a mood to talk to anyone at that early hours. I was scared, so holding by bag tightly was walking, with 250 mts ahead saw 2 people walking with flash light and i was relieved by seeing them. Though i was walking briskly and counting the stars, was scared to death of any sound which was close by (bikes, jeep or horses). These kept me haunting for next 2 kms, was thinking whether am doing anything stupid or crazy at such early hours and not sure what i was scared about?Post 3 kms saw huge bunch girls who was seated around the roads, was completely relieved by seeing them, they were waiting as they didn&apos;t have lights and i had to guide them with lights, now i have company all through and reached the sun rise point I within 1 hours. I could have started a bit later, but however was seated in the direction for the sun to switch on the day.Almost waited for 1.5 hours ad the sun started brightening up at 4.45. The complete Mt Bromo and Mt meru came in to my visual existence only at 6.30. Bumped on many people and couple of people from russia who kept me engaged and we had good fun clicking pictures of each other. At 7.0 started descending the whole and was figuring out the route which was walking in dark. Within few minutes i bumped into Martin who came as a savior to give me a clear route from sun rise point to Crater. There was a route which you could bye pass the ticket, as straightly there is no reason we had to pay so much cash while looking in to the volcano. Based on his advice took the route, though he was ahead of me lost him as he was rushing. Based on the my instinct and local guidance took the right from cemro indah and took a trail, there was a lady walking ahead of me and few horses in the trail. While i was almost down the trail realized the i was right on the track, i told myself in case i miss somewhere its fine i will come back same route and miss the crater. An tactic to convince my scary mind. After 15 min, was walking in the sea of sands, Vast area covered with soft sand and with the temple as landmark, need to walk diagonal to reach the temple. As you reach the temple you could see the people heading to crater. The last few steps are really tiring ones to see the crater and its bubbling water with fumes. The ridge is narrow and if you have a agility you could walk around, else get burned into the crater. Now am from other side of the mountain to the this side and mt bromo was very close by for me. The temple looks like a miniature. After spending sometime, started descending, was fueling with my food rations and started walking. When i suddenly saw someone walking by and on all probability it was martin and we chatted a bit and started the to reach the room. Now i had several tress passers giving me company &amp; i didn&apos;t find a single Indian anywhere in java.The sea of sand and the crater is magnanimous &amp; Every single step in the sea of sand will make you muddy. Reached the trail,now i am exhausted after 6 hours of self exploration, taking slow steps reached the home stay.On all terms i need a complete head to toe wash, While returning me and martin were discussing the hardness in getting the buses. We decided to meet up at the bus station and while i refreshed and packing took an hour to reached the bus station. Now there were 9 other people who were bargaining with the driver and happy to see folks saving penny for me. Bread, cheese and juice were my stable post the 13 kms hike. It took another 2 hours to reach and a good chat with Martin in the bus who has been travelling Indonesia since 1 month.While i read that Mt Ijen was open and was disheartened and now that i have booked the tickets cant change the plans. So decided to let go and was sure cant cover everything within 10 days. Took another bus to surabaya from probolingo which took another 2.5 hours. Now all i that i want is sleep and food, was eating everything i had from apple to dark chocolate. All i was missing on that day was idly, dosai and curd rice. There was only food on my mind nothing else.After getting tried to find out some veg food and all i vain, had donuts and chocolate drink to fulllfill the tank. Got into damri bus to airport which took around 25-30 minutes. Reached the airport and had avaocado juice and rested at the airport &amp; the flight was delayed for an hour. The internet package stopped working and was trying to figure out.Its a long day from 2.30 am and haven&apos;t had a sleep yet, boarded the flight and was reading a book. A girl next seat started the conversation on the book i was reading and as she was. She was trying to figure out whereabouts in bali and told her my internet package stopped working and need to work out while i get down. She convinced me to give her internet package card as it will be hard for me, not sure how people bumped on what i want. Though i hesitated she forced me so, as she claimed its very cheap for locals to buy one. Took it sheepishly and then next turn i booked a cab and he was trying to talk in bahansi and i couldn&apos;t explain him. There was another person at the airport whom i checked on the driver language offered the drop, i was scared to take a call on this and studied the cab driver was woman and he dropped me at hostel at bali. Finally at Bali after 21 hours.Though i was exhausted, my room was full of girls and they were so active. All i wanted to sleep off without thinking any plan for next day. Slept around 1.30 am in a disturbed fashionDay 7 : Tanoh temple, Ubud, Monkey Forest, Ubud Palace At 6.0 am up and the front desk was surprised to see me waking up early, they supply pancakes so i prepared several layers and had coffee. It was a fulfilling meal after several days which really opened my eyes, rather it was only heavenly meal i had. Mean while rented the scooter and decided to leave UBUD and sorted the day plan. Left the big bags there and took 1 day pack and started the scooter. All through Indonesia has narrow 2 way roads and it take really longer time to reach even shorter distance. I straightly booked the scooter for 3 days so that i claimed some discount, now with the weight of cash reducing am spending in a calculative fashion.It took 1 hour to reach tanoh temple and spend some time relaxing there, reached around 1.30 at ubud hostel. Enroute you could vision green paddy fields and the smell would throng you. Rested for a while and started to monkey temple and spent around 2 hours and then to palace. While i exited the place near by saw a indian cuisine, went and had mushroom pulav and chick peas masala. Finished the dinner around evening itself and then headed to Ubud market. It very happening place and shopped few souvenirs. you have extremely good in bargaining as they would hike the price the 4 times and its your talent to slash it down at least twice. Mostly the shops are closed by 6.0 PM. refreshed the day and charting out the plan for next day and again the female dorm was empty and AC wasn&apos;t working fine. Ubud is a wonderful ancient place which looks historic, ancient and the roads are extremely good. As i had scooter-ed could absorb the roads and the placeOh this is definitely not a vacation, am on wheels getting up early every day and started to ridge walk. With my research located easily as its bit hidden and they were several who were running. Walked beyond karfe cafe and had my first glimpse of rice terrace, was enjoying the walk and returned back after walking 4 kms. Cliff is an must to do walk either in the morning or evening hours. Headed straight to tegallang rice garden which is another 30 minutes. The rice garden is completely green several layers of paddy, its well maintained and walked down the fields. The farmers would ask for donation, after some up and down walk. Found my favourite tampei and Indomaret. Its fuel time seeing these two as a break fast. While enroute to ubud found several good shops for sovenier retail and wholesale, stopped at a place and shopped few. Returned to the hostel and had plans to to go water falls near by, Somehow i lost interest and got tired of the whole thing. Slept for a while and decided to let go falls and started to kuta. A long drive waited for me and luckily the temperature was dropping by.While i was driving found a juice shop and he had Indonesia dessert and while i was talking with him he suggested to have some dish near by. Had laklak and reach the hostel in the evening hours. After settling down went for sun set to kuta beach, after a long walk returned back to hostel through the market road. Was checking on the massage and tatoo. Had chilly corn and reached hostel and slept off post a refreshstarted early and merely there was no plan in my head, was very tired of driving and went to nusa dua for sunrise. Beaches are crystal clear, enjoyed the transparency for sometime and started ahead to uluwattu. It was the day for detour, not sure what was running on my mind i was taking all wrong turns and headed in the wrong way. After several detours visited padang padang &amp; binbing beach which is kind of deserted and scary. Was chased by dogs in the scooter and but had a good view of the beaches. Was tired and exhausted, decided to wrap up the exploration and head straight to hostel. I truly understand i need to come to back to bali as i i had many other things to do(missed scuba diving, Nusa pendia, gill island to visit). Well there is always a next best time.Post reaching the hostel, decided on the tatoo i wanted and went for massage nearby, it wasn&apos;t convincing still was ok, refreshed immediately and went straight for tatoo. Painful process but got through it. Went to the market and had some food. Came to hostel and all set and packed to depart. This day i was only in the mood to depart and nothing was captivating. Started bit early based on the road experience, as it took 1 hour to reach the hostel while i reached. Return malindo flights was very comfortable, slept like a horse from bali to Malaysia. Post i reached KL, was flooring the airport was it was good one and then headed again for some food. Got the early morning flight and reached ChennaiParents : Who allows &amp; trust me to exploreBoss : Who blesses vacation leavesIndonesian People : Those ever who helped &amp; guided me even in providing a little information Lara : Who got some food when I was bedridden and helped me to recover Muthyara : for giving me the free internet packageTHE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS BLOG IS BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE\nDay 1JavaHotelsMap",

So my journey started from Bangalore as I have to stay there for next one month so I decided to go alone to some unknown place or the place which is quite peaceful. So I booked my tickets from Bangalore to madanpalle through APSRTC which is quite affordable. But I forget about the language barrier which I think is a unsolvable problem, especially when you are travelling to some small town as conductor don&apos;t understand English as well as hindi. Even though you might not have any issues in Chennai or other major cities, its a different ballgame in small towns and villages when you have to communicate with them, when they don&apos;t know ABCD of English. So After 8 hrs journey finally the bus stop at madanpalle bus stop and here again I have to catch a bus to Horshley Hills and here a lady conductor is in bus, and again I&apos;m unable to say that I have to go horshley Hills (As at there it&apos;s called Horsleykonda, which I don&apos;t know at that moment)So I tried all possible things but all I got after spending time there was, &quot;Sir, language problem sir&quot; and at last I came up with idea taking help from Google translation and finally she got it right.But after all those fights from conductor and hectic experience, I ended up in sitting at a edge of a cliff of Horshley Hill and as I finally trek 10 km, the sweat start drying I feel relaxed and for next 4hrs I enjoyed that view and cold air throwing on my skin asking me to let the tiredness out. So if you ask me that, is it scary out there ?It depends on you how you approach them. And every experience teach you something new, all you have to do is don&apos;t lose your job which is trying to achieve what you made as a Traveller. Thank youDead end Into the Wild with wildcraft",

It was originally established as a military garrison by the British know as The Garhwal Rifles and they still train in town today .One interesting fact I came across while interacting with one of the military personnels was that unlike other military regiments in India which are mix of soldiers&#xA0; from various parts , Gharwal Rifles is still indigenous and only consists of people who are native to that place.The Trip Begins......Lansdowne is about 275 kms from Gurgaon , so we expected 7-8 hours of motorcycle ride .&#xA0;The trip was pre-planned and since it was a along weekend , we decided we would leave on Sunday and be back by Tuesday . Me and my friend had taken leave on Monday , and Tuesday being a holiday , we had ample time for the trip.We left Gurgaon , at around 8 am (we had decided to start the trip at 4 am , but none of us could wake up ) , started towards our destination . The trip took us through Noida , Greater , Noida , Ghaziabad &amp; Meerut . The moment we entered Meerut&#xA0; , we were caught in a nasty traffic jam at around 9.30 am . We regrettted immediatly for not waking up early . So we decided to have our breakfast .We stopped at one&#xA0; of the road side dhabas , and had a light breakfast. Even after 45 mins of waiting , there was no sign of easing up of congestion . Without wasting another minute we doned our riding gears , and continued the journey forward .&#xA0;The roads were good apart form minor potholes . Traffic was light as soon we crossed Meerut and our average cruising speed was 70-80 km/hr.As it was the starting of the summer season , we had to have several pit-stops to quench our thirsts with sugarcane juice . We even stopped at one of the police stations for filling up our bottles .We reached Kothwara , at around 1 PM , which is a major town before Lansdowne.After Kothwara , our journey through dangerous , narrow , &amp; spiralling roads was to begin .So we decided for a brief pit stop.&#xA0;After resting for half n hour , we regained our journey.The drive through these mountainous&#xA0; roads will put your driving skills to test.It is totally advisable not drive harshly on these roads otherwise .We had pre-booked a hotel amidst&#xA0; the mountains on a hill-top , in the middle of nowhere .The view was breathetaking and even at night we did not feel the requirement of a fan and as vaguly I can recall , I had to put on a blanket at night .\nTip N TopHotelsMapThere are not many places to visit in Lansdowne.But one can definately find Places like Gharwali Museum , Tip n Top , ST Mary&apos;s Church , all in the&#xA0; the vicinity of each other.",

		"Text": "Paris happens to be the romantic capital of the world. After coming to London, the first right decision which took was to have all documents in place and apply for a Schengen Visa. We decided to explore for our Christmas break. \nDay 1L&#x27;Arc CaféHotelsMapWe reached Paris at about 9:00 am on 17th December. The first thing which we did was our traditional breakfast at L&apos; Arc Cafe. We boarded the French metro(M1) from Paris city centre- Bercy and reached the 27 avenue for this cafe. Here we had traditional breakfast which included french cheese Omelette, Cappuccino and french muffins.Arc de TriompheHotelsMapAfter the delicious mouth watering breakfast, we headed towards Arc de Triomphe- one of the signature arcs of France. The construction of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris started in 1806 by Napoleon, the French Emperor. This was because he wanted to honor the Grande Armee(the name of the French army at that time).The Grande Armee had conquered most of Europe and was then considered invincible. The skip the line ticket is &#xA3;11 per adult. The timings to visit this 10:00 am to 10:30 am.Heading up the terrace one can click beautiful pictures of the city. Arc had mentioned the names of all matyr soldiers who died serving their country.It also had french army uniforms displayed over the period of time. The war equipments and even the war prison was found as we went inside. e arch stands 150-feet (50-meter) tall and is 148-feet (45-meter) wide. It&#x2019;s so big that after World War I ended, a pilot celebrated by flying his biplane through it.Cathédrale Notre-Dame de ParisHotelsMapAfter visiting this epic monument, we walked down Champs Elysees the premium road of Paris. On our way we also grabbed some french macrons from the famous shop Laduree. The second place which we now visited was Cath&#xE9;drale Notre-Dame de Paris. Cath&#xE9;drale Notre-Dame de Paris is symbolically considered the heart of the city. It is one of the main medieval Catholic cathedrals on the &#xCE;le de la Cit&#xE9; in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France.The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Even if it was damaged a lot during french revolution, after restoration it is among the best known largest churches not only in France but also the whole world. The calmness and serenity inside makes it a pious place where one sit for hours. The entry here is free and it is flooded with tourists who visit to admire the interiors of the world famous cathedral.Notre DamThe glasses and the eye dazzling architecture depicts Rayonnant style where the glasses where strained with carvings.Eiffel TowerHotelsMapAfter visiting this, we decided to visit the the legendary and the most epic Eiffel Tower. It is beautiful and worth visiting even during the night because of its night light decoration. This is considered to the prime landmark of Paris. It is named after Gustave Eiffel who contributed to its construction and designing. Eiffel originally designed the tower to be built in Barcelona, but the Spanish council decided it was too expensive and did not match the aesthetics of the city. Eiffel tower had two levels the first and second floor. The approx waiting time is 30 to 45 minutes but it was worth standing at the top of that legendary tower. One of the highlights was the small shops near the tower serving chocolate pancakes, waffles and mulled wine. Admission to the Eiffel Tower varies according to which floor you want to visit. It&#x2019;s &#x20AC;16.00 to take the lift to the second floor and &#x20AC;25.00 to the top. One can take tickets from Viator and GetYourGuide, they are the best online portals for purchasing ticketsDay 2Louvre MuseumHotelsMapThe second day started with the foggy morning and covering the outstanding Eiffel tower. This was located in the main Paris city. We today decided to have breakfast in the shops near Eiffel tower to enjoy the view. After this, we proceeded towards the most beautiful and enriched Louvre Museum in Rue de Rivoli. The total entrance fee for this is &#x20AC;9. The exterior of museum has been a significant part in various movies like Da Vinci Code, James Bond etc.Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s artistic masterpiece Monalisa can be found in this which is displayed here with pride and vanity. Apart from this place has some sculptures like the Winged Victory of Samothrace which is also known as the Nike of Samothrace. (2nd-century BC marble sculpture of the Greek goddess Nike Victory),Venus de Milo (with missing limbs etc).Day 3Disneyland ParisHotelsMapI also came to know interesting facts about Louvre. Louvre happens to be the world&apos;s biggest museum of the world.Today the Louvre Museum is the world&#x2019;s most visited museum, averaging 15,000 visitors per day, 65 percent of whom are foreign tourists.The collection of the museum has been divided into eight parts-- Near Eastern Antiquities, Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities, Egyptian Antiquities, Paintings, Prints and Drawings, Decorative Arts, Sculptures, and Islamic Art.Day 2KadoyaHotelsMapAfter covering some sections of the museum,we headed towards one most prominent place of Paris which is Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris. This was a typical roman catholic church which celebrated the sacred heart of Jesus Christ. Its construction started in 1875 and ended in 1914.&#xA0;After visiting the Basilica, we headed to a Japanese restaurant for dinner. The name of the restaurant is Kadoya Restaurant. Here we explored all range of sea food and tried something out of the box. We not tried traditional sushi but also tasted traditional maki, chicken skewers, karage ramen, prawn tempura etc.Day 3Disneyland ParisHotelsMapThis is was indeed the most awaited part of my trip. I was super thrilled because I was visiting it for the first time. I always had this wish to visit the Paris Disneyland after Hong-kong and it was special because I visited it with my most special person who is my husband.The first day we decided to explore the Disneyland park. The theme park made us nostalgic and we got carried away with the magic of Disney. The first day had little less dangerous rides as I was afraid to try the rides. However we enjoyed the Disney parade and watched the show Mickey and the Magician. There were some thrilling rides which completed my share of adventure for the first day. Some of them were Indiana Jones at le temple, Peter pan ride, Crush&apos;s Coaster, Buzz lightyear Laser blast. The day finally ended with Ratatouille&apos;s 3D adventure.The second day we covered Walt Disney Studio. It had more rib chilling rides which made me skip my heart&apos;s beat. One of the most terrifying experience was Twilight zone of terror. Some of the other rides included Big thunder mountain, Rock Roller Coaster with Aerosmith guitar ride and Toy soldier Parachute drop. After reviving and surviving the rides, we took the toy train ride to explore the real life behind the reel life. The trip ultimately ended with sparkling Disney fireworks and with the promise that we shall again meet, rejoice and relive the magic.",

There is a small stream flowing beside it.&#xA0; We sat there and enjoyed our evening.Day 2Next day after breakfast, we headed towards budher caves and kanasar.&#xA0; The road to kanasar from budher caves diversion is pathetic.&#xA0; We abandoned to visit budher caves as we are in medium segment car with low ground clearance as the 1.5 km stretch was rocky and unsafe for these type of vehicles.&#xA0; We somehow reached kanasar at a speed of bullock cart due to pathetic road.&#xA0; There was only a small ground with no eating joints.&#xA0; We were feeling hungry but to no avail.&#xA0; After about an hour we started back.&#xA0; Then we visited chakrata market.&#xA0; It&apos;s a small market with few eating joints, vegetable shops and army uniform shops as it&apos;s a cantonment area of army.&#xA0; We bought rajma from there which are famous of chakrata.&#xA0; Then we proceeded to chilmiri top.&#xA0; As we reached there, all our disappointment of kanasar and bad road vanished due to cool wind and beautiful weather and scenic beauty of top.&#xA0; It&apos;s a hilltop from where one can see valley 360 degrees.&#xA0; Views were amazing with cool wind.&#xA0; People go there to see sunrise and sunset.&#xA0; We spent time enjoying the view and weather and waiting for sunset.&#xA0; It was amazing.&#xA0; After spending about 3 hours we returned to our hotel.&#xA0; And next morning we headed back to Chandigarh. Chakrata is a great weekend location from Chandigarh and Delhi with few crowds, cool weather and nature. Must visit.Way to tiger fallsView from our resortMehta resortSunset at chilmiri topChilmiri topValley view",

		"Text": "Day 1Staring across the windows of your car, making way through a narrow and crowded road in Kolkata, you read &apos;GT Road&apos; or &apos;the Grant trunk road&apos;. Yes, the same road built by Chandragupta Maurya two millenniums before, rebuilt by Shershah and then by the British. When you&apos;re in Kolkata, you walk through the streets of time, beautifully carved out of histories, histories unwilling to be buried under the invincible clutches of time.To see trams run through the rails that have been laid from the past is like taking a ride through history.&#xA0; The fact that trams find a space in today&apos;s busiest roads of Kolkata itself is the proof that past and present coexist in the &apos;city of joy&apos;. A tram in Kolkata (source: google)Park Street areaHotelsMapThe Park street or &quot;the street that never sleeps &quot; has been and still is the most sought after thoroughfare in the &apos;city of joy&apos;. It has been the entertainment hub, food hub and the location of major hotels in the city from the British era itself. Not for the &apos;Indianness&apos; intrinsically woven into the street, the street would have reflected the streets in&#xA0; London. Park street, Kolkata (source: google)Belur MathHotelsMapKolkata is not mere &apos;Calcutta&apos; , but the capital of&#xA0; &apos;Bengal&apos;, where philosophy, art, music, literature flourished, thus home to the greatest of pioneers of Renaissance like Iswara Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra&#xA0; Chattopadhyaya, RajaRam MohanRoy, Ravindranath Tagore and the greatest Swami Vivekananda. Belur math on the banks of Hugli&#xA0; has been the epitome of philosophical renaissance since its inception by Swami Vivekananda in 1938. Visit to this headquarters of Ramakrishna mission took a front seat on my visit to kolkata. The peaceful air cooled down by the waters of Hugli, untouched by the hustle and bustle of Kolkata, offers more than enough for a soul inquisitive to know the &apos;brahma&apos;. The books of in-depth knowledge and the highest philosophies are available at cheaper prices. Belur Math(source: google)Dakshineswar Kali TempleHotelsMapThe spiritual guru of Swami Vivekananda,&#xA0; Shri Ram krishna paramahamsa got spiritual revelation here in Dakshnineswar temple.&#xA0; The&#xA0; temple on the opposite bank of the Hugli can be reached through a boat journey costing you Rs 10. But the locally operated boat, in its collapsible form might cost you your life, I assumed. After the monsoons the Hugli was in full capacity and I was lost in its vastness. The small ride offered sights to the dirtiest ghats and the polluted riversides.&#xA0; The people in the boat had an expression impervious to the surroundings, they seemed to be the least cared of anything. The Hugli (snap from the boat journey)Dakshineswar Kali temple (source: google)Howrah BridgeHotelsMapThe suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, third longest of its type during its construction, still remains an engineering marvel. It&apos;s the symbol of Kolkata and forgetting uber,&#xA0; a ride through this bridge in the typical yellow taxi of Kolkata gifts you an old world charm, exclusive to Calcutta.Through Howrah bridge, in a yellow taxi :)Day 2KalighatHotelsMapLegend has it, Calcutta or the new Kolkata got its name after the famous &apos;Kalighat&apos; temple in the heart of the city. Reading MK Gandhi&apos;s autobiography, one would have come across a subtle reference to this temple during the mahatma&apos;s&#xA0; stay in Calcutta. The temple has the angriest form of Hindu deity Kali, and Kalighat gets etched in our memory with blood red flowers everywhere and noisy atmosphere in the background. The famous &apos;Kalighat painting&apos; also has its origin in Kalighat.Kali idol in Kalighat (source: google)Victoria MemorialHotelsMapThe memorial built for the Queen Victoria in what would have been the capital of India but for the shift of capital to Luyten&apos;s Delhi before its construction, stands, ironically, as an attractive memorial to the unattractive colonial history of India. It hosts a museum that sheds light upon the colonial past of our great nation.The victoria memorial, KolkataThus I covered the old capital of India that has many adjectives to describe it within 24 hours. Kolkata is a journey in itself, from the past to the present, from the dirtiest to the cleanest. It&apos;s like turning the pages of history of India. It hosts the poorest and the richest. The remains of its unblemished culture , art, architecture, music, philosophy and literature try very hard to tell us something in the midst of today&apos;s busiest metropolis, the voices audible only to those who listen with a love for &apos;Calcutta&apos;.&#xA0; The last thing I did was to grab some of the famous Bengali sweets, for sweetness is what represents the &apos;city of joy&apos;. Happy travelling :)Kolkata reminds us of CalcuttaRasmalai, the sweet from Bengal(source: google)",

		"Text": "Himachal PradeshHotelsMapI stood transfixed, at the edge of a frigid, swirling mass of madness that was the Rani river. The majestic ice-tipped Himalayas looked over my shoulder, seemingly uninterested in this fantastic twilight view, perhaps having seen it all. A cold draft blew across the clearing, straying over our tents and rustling the luminescent silver birch on the forest edge.A cackling laugh pulled me out of my reverie.&#x201C;Jump&#x201D;, he cheered at the crowd wildly, as the cold gushing Rani swallowed him up to his waist, fed on a steady diet of freshly melted snow.Bundled up in thick layers and wary of the icy conclusion, his audience only looked on reluctantly.Having succeeded in getting all eyes on him, he guffawed promptly and dunked his head below the surface as others could only gander in amazement and broke out into applause.Tiger, everyone named him - the moniker perhaps drawn from a close resemblance to a movie star of the world&#x2019;s largest film industry, Bollywood.He had a Sufiesque air about him - long serpentine lengths of hair parted neatly off his forehead and wild brown eyes that you couldn&#x2019;t stand up to in a stare-off.Once, when people hustled for the shared warmth of the dining tent, he spoke of the times gone by, and the rapid change he had observed in the Kullu valley.He reminisced sitting cross-legged on the ground as his Nana weaved incredible stories of his fishing for trout in the cold Himalayan waters, a profession Tiger once hoped to pursue when he grew up.He noted, with dark resentment in his voice, that one could now simply &#x2018;catch&#x2019; trout in one of the many commercial trout farms that lined the winding roads leading up to Manali.Denied his dream, he ran away from his village home, but returned, several years wiser. Though he stayed away now, working as a guide for the thriving trek business in the valley, he visited them often.Tiger had a penchant for theatrics. Often, he would abruptly break into song, most from his pahadi origin, which, although strange sounding, had a rather mellifluous tone to them. Of course, he expected the applause, loud and unrestrained.Taaliyon ki kami nahi honi chahiye, he would declare.Let the applause continueHe performed for his admirers. His chose his stage, his moments and much like most performers, revelled in their applause.Perhaps that was his life&#x2019;s philosophy. Simple, unrestrained.He was often a showman, sometimes, a philosopher, and in his spare time, a guide to the mystic terrains of the Himalayas.",

		"Text": "Day 1Along with my girl friend, I had gone to Sundernagar in Himachal for a wedding. Even though Sundernagar is an important town of Himachal which falls in the Delhi-Manali route only 22km before Mandi, a lot of people are unaware about this town. In fact, when I left my home I had told everyone that I&apos;m leaving for a wedding in Sunder Nagar and they assumed that I was on my way to Sunder Nagar (Delhi). This small town of&#xA0; Sundernagar does not have much to explore within itself except for a few temples and a lake which seems to be running parallel to the main highway.With not much to do in Sundernagar after checking in at our Polo Regency Hotel, we decided to go explore a bit. Until I had reached Sundernagar, I had heard about Rewalsar long time back but wasn&apos;t aware that it would just be 30kms away from Sundernagar. Having the more popular Parashar Lake also closeby, lot of travellers these days opt going there for trekking or camping. Our hotel being very close to the bus stand we found a small indica cab very conveniently. The cabbie charged us Rs 1200 for a round trip to Rewalsar as well as waiting for the time while we explored.The distance wasn&apos;t much but the road was slightly narrow and a bit winding even though luckily there was a proper road. We read in an hours time to Rewalsar and the driver dropped us close to the Statue of Padmasambhava. Overlooking the Lake, this 12 metre high statue is the main attraction of the place. It took us 10 to 15 minutes to walk up till the main entrance at a very leisurely place and we spent about 20 minutes or so exploring it. One gets a beautiful panoramic view of the holy city of Rewalsar from the top.Rewalsar Lake infact is considered as one of the most sacred lakes in Himachal and is revered by Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs. There is an equally popular Nanda Devi temple nearby but running short of time and having a wedding to tend to, we had to give that a miss. Thereafter, we walked our way down and roamed around the lake a bit to realize that there are three temples which are dedicated to Lord Krishna, Lord Shiva and Sage Lomas. Further ahead, there is also a famous Gurudwara called the Guru Gobind Singh Gurudwara built in 1930 and worshipped by the Sikh people.But before we reached the Gurudwara which was very close to where our car was parked, we were craving for some good food and ended up at Emaho Cafe which is located very close to a monastery and is one of the most frequented cafes out there. Being quite an odd hour to serve either lunch or dinner, their menu was quite limited and we just ended up having a shake and a brownie here and went ahead to explore more food joints. We finally saw a lot of people around Norbu Fast Food corner and even though the place was really small and served only Momos, noodles and Thukpa it was well worth the visit. The Mutton Momos were out of the world and one of the best I have had till dateThe Thukpa was different yet scrumptious. And tell Bill did not even come a 100 bucks.After filling our stomachs, it was time for us to head to our cab as our cabbie was waiting anxiously as we had far exceeded the prescribed time limit. Such is the charm of this beautiful small town that one loses track of time as one get immersed in it&apos;s beauty. The Sun was almost down by then and we bid our final farewell to Rewalsar by going to the viewing point on the lake for one last time.Rewalsar Lake from TopViewing PointMutton Momos Guru Rinpoche or PadmasambhavaDrukpa InstituteThe Stair Case to the StatueSome Thukpa SoupEmaho Cafe",

Since it was same day we could not get a volvo bus, but we were able to get an AC bus which was 60% comfortable and costed us Rs550 per ticket. Though the bus departed at 11:30pm, we reached nanital at 7:30am of march 12. As i am from Karnataka and deprived of lofty mountains, when i looked at hill station and the lake, trust me! i wanted (still want) to stay there forever. Nainital&apos;s winter was still on in march and it was 10&apos;c when we reached. Now, we were looking for stay which is cheap and decent. Many local persons will approach you to show hotel rooms. We got a room which was rs500/night with lake view, clean and decent and its name was hotel lake view (it was more of guest house), amenities like hot water, restaurant facility, sight seeing with extra taxi charges was available. We had paranthans, actually good ones than delhi. We enquired for sight seeing, via hotel and the charges were Rs1000. There were 6 to 7 places like tiffin top, suicide point, eco cave gardens, naina devi temple and so on. You can also go for adventure activities but you have to book early, activities listed in this link https://allseasonsz.com/uttarakhand/nainital_tourism/nainital-adventure-attractions.asp . Hiring a taxi outside hotel will cost upto Rs700 after bargaining. so go out and find one, dont be lazy like us :P It was around 6pm when we reached mall road, we is last destination in the sight seeing list. A good quality sweater costed me Rs600 after bargaining, its so warm, at 6 degree c it kept me warm. we had dinner in the mall road, it was good. we went to naina devi mandir and gurudwara which is side by side in mall road.\nNainitalHotelsMap2nd day we went for boating in nani lake, and some shopping in local market (not the mall road one). We spent the day walking by lakeside, eating and shopping. I remember the momos which was yum! we brought some apricot. We were lucky to witness rain at evening ,hailstorm at around 7pm and it was beautiful. We had a bus at 9:30pm to Delhi. While coming back to Delhi we got state govt Volvo bus and it costed us Rs1500/person.",

		"Text": "A land of pristine lakes, picturesque waterfalls cradled by lush mountains whose horizons are guarded by mighty snow-capped behemoths and blessed by mystical chants from centuries old monasteries. Seems like a wonderland from a fairy tale? Very much so! And this fairy tale place is the sleepy little town of Pelling in Sikkim.Pelling welcomes all visitors with a laid back atmosphere. With the omnipresent views of the mighty Mt. Kanchenjunga, the town soothes the tired souls of all travellers. Located in the West Sikkim district, at an altitude of 2,150 m (7,200 feet) Pelling is 10 kms from the district headquarters of Geyzing. The town is colloquially divided into Lower and Upper Pelling with the helipad ground sandwiched between them.A paradise for the &quot;escapists&quot; trying to run away from the cacophony of the city lives, it is a hill station like no other. An atmosphere of peace hangs around the town, among chirruping birds and prayers emanating from the confines of the nearby monasteries. During the day, one is always under a canopy of green with the sun playing hide and seek from behind the branches and an awning of twinkling stars smiles back at night. An addictive fragrance from the mountain blossoms and incense sticks from monasteries fills the air while festoons of brightly colored prayer flags flutter away carelessly in the brisk Himalayan breeze.Pelling offers an ensemble of places to visit with immersive experiences to take back and cherish for a lifetime. From gushing waterfalls to centuries old monasteries shrouded in seclusion, from ruins of the old capital to serene paths to walk on, Pelling has it all, under the ever present blessings of Mt. Kanchenjunga.\nKanchenjunga FallsHotelsMapKanchenjunga Falls: Half an hour&apos;s drive (25 kms) from Pelling, Kanchenjunga falls is a perennial waterfall that is one of the major tourist attractions in the region. Gushing through wooded hills, it is an uninterrupted torrent of glacial melt plummeting from a high cliff creating a deep plunge pool. The deafening roar adds more awe to the already dramatic environment. It is believed that the pristine waterfall originates high up in the glaciers of Mount Kanchenjunga.Kanchenjungha Falls. Photo: From Google.Rimbi Water FallsHotelsMapRimbi Falls: Situated amidst lush forests another beautiful waterfall is the Rimbi Falls. About 12 kms away from Pelling, Rimbi falls flows down gracefully bathing the shrubs and ferns on the way down.One of the prime attractions of Pelling, the falls is a magnet for tourists, photographers and waterfalls lovers alike.Rimbi FallsPelling - Dentam RoadHotelsMapChangey Falls: Changey (or Tshange) falls is located about 10 kms from Pelling. Plunging from a height of about 50 metres, these falls are on the way to Dentam Valley. a cascade of dazzling while, like a drape of white silk on a backdrop of dense green, the falls flows over the road before vanishing down the cliffs on the opposite side into a dizzying abyss.Changey Falls. Photo: From GoogleKhecheopalri LakeHotelsMapKhecheopalri Lake: Located 34 kms to the northwest of Pelling town, Khecheopalri lake is a revered lake. It is considered sacred by both Buddhists and Hindus. Set amidst beautiful broad-leaved mixed temperate forests, the lake is believed to be a wish fulfilling lake. It is believed that birds do not permit even a single leaf to float on the Khecheopalri lake, and as soon as a leaf falls, it is carried away by the birds.The lake and the surrounding forests make a pristine milieu. The pathway leading to the lake is flanked by huge trees decorated with garlands of prayer flags. A uninterrupted solitude engulfs the whole whole place, punctuated only by the welcome songs of the Himalayan birds. A small Buddhist shrine located on the lake shore enhances the serenity of the lake. One can simply sit and while away hours by the lake shore and feel connected with mother nature.Khecheopalri Lake.Pemayangtse MonasteryHotelsMapPemayangtse Monastery: Planned, designed and founded by Lama Lhatsun Chempo in 1705, it is one of the oldest and premier monasteries of Sikkim, also the most famous in West Sikkim. Pemayangtse Monastery follows the Nyingma Order of Tibetan Buddhism and controls all other monasteries of that Order in Sikkim. The monks of this monastery are normally chosen from the Bhutias of Sikkim.Dizzyingly coloured, the two story structure is shrouded by an atmosphere of peace and serenity. The omnipresent views of Mt. Kanchenjunga from the monastery confines enhances and exemplifies the pious environment of the monastery. Esoteric rhythms of Lamas chanting prayers from century old scriptures lends an even more mystical charm to the place.Rabdentse RuinsHotelsMapRabdenste Ruins: Located close to the Pemayangtse Monastery, Rabdentse was the second capital of the former kingdom of Sikkim from 1670 to 1814. The capital city was destroyed by the invading Gurkha army and only the ruins of the palace and the chortens are seen here now. Perched atop a ridge above upper Pelling the ruins primarily consist of &#x201C;chunky wall stubs&#x201D; whose heritage value is accentuated by its location. This former capital offers commanding views of the Kanchenjunga massif on one side and the mountains and valleys on the other side are visible. This monument has been declared as of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of Indi&quot;:Photo: From GoogleSingshore BridgeHotelsMapSingshore Bridge: Located at a distance of 28 kms from Pelling, the Singshore Bridge is an engineering marvel. Said to be the second highest hanging bridge in Asia, it is one of the places worth visiting. Standing at the Centre of the Bridge, one can gauge the depth of the gorge below and a wonderful view of the jungle&apos;s Flora &amp; Fauna.Decorated with colorful prayer flags, an hallmark of Sikkim, the bridge sways in the strong breeze which sometimes make walking on it a nerve wracking experience. The surrounding hills are a mind boggling ensemble of every shade of green imaginable. During monsoon, clouds encroach the valley and engulfs the bridge enunciating the charm of the already alluring place.Sanga Choeling Monastery: The Sanga Choeling Monastery was established in the 17th century by Lama Lhats&#xFC;n Chempo, is one of the oldest monasteries in Sikkim. The literal meaning of Sanga Choeling is &quot;Island of the Guhyamantra teachings&#x201D;. The monastery is built in a Tibetan style of architecture, and houses a sacred three centuries old Buddhist crematorium named Dhuthoe Silwar Tshar.The monastery is located on a ridge top above Pelling at a distance of 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from Pemayangtse Monastery and 2 kms from Pelling. The shrine is access via foot trail, roughly a forty minute uphill hike, which traverses through rich forest cover.The majestic Singshore Bridge. Photo: From GoogleSanga Choeling Monastery. Photo: From Wikipedia.Fact File:Nearest airport from Pelling: Bagdogra Airport is the nearest airport from Pelling, located about 160 km away. It is connected to Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. One can hire a cab or take a shared cab from Siliguri to reach Pelling.Nearest railway station from Pelling: New Jalpaiguri Station, at a distance of 152 km. It is, again, connected to Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. Taxis are easily available outside the station.The roads in Pelling are in a nice condition, and thus taking a bus or a rented/private vehicle is a good idea. However, owing to high elevation it&#x2019;s better visited in SUVs similar vehicle.For more information and other stories, visit my personal blog at&#xA0;Restless Feet and my Instagram handle&#xA0;restless_feet_traveller.",

		"Text": "While i was planning my trip last year in May, one of the major challenge was to find a place that is not too hot in this weather in Asia. After a lot of research, we finalized Indonesia and trust be it was one of the best decisions and one of the most fulfilling trips of my life.After booking our tickets, we started our research around 20 days before the trip and were contemplating between going to Bali and Java or Bali plus Gili Islands. Finally we zeroed in Bali &amp; Java as we had never seen volcanoes and the thought of seeing Mt Bromo and Ijen crater excited us to the core. I will share my story on Java island in my next post :)So here i am sharing why should Bali be your next travel desitnation..1. Ofcourse for the beaches it has to offer.Even their popular tourist beaches like Seminyak beach are clean and beautiful plus there are a lot of unexplored and secret beaches to chill at . Weather you want to take a dip or just take a walk, you will have enough beautiful beaches here.Seminyak Beach\nSeminyak BeachHotelsMapBlue Point BeachHotelsMap  \t2. Sunsets : If you love watching sunsets, Bali is the place for you. I spent 8 days in Bali and everyday i found a new place to witness sunsets and trust me each one was prettier than the previous one.Uluwatu TempleHotelsMap  \t  \t3. The cultural capital of Bali, UBUD. After spending 3 fulfilling days in Seminyak, we took a cab for Ubud . It is one of those cities that you instantly fall in love with, the city has something for everyone. It is a perfect mix of nature ,waterfalls, rice gardens, temples, shopping, restaurants, cafe etc.Ubud Water PalaceHotelsMapPura Ulun Danu BuyanHotelsMapTegalalang Rice TerraceHotelsMap4. Tegalalang Rice Garden - Possibly the most popular of the things to do in Ubud and definitely the most famous rice fields in Asia. The beautiful tiers of green shine amongst the sun and make for an awesome afternoon walk in Ubud.   \t4.For stunning yet affordable resorts and homestays&#xA0; - Our resort in Ubud , Pemuteran and Java (will cover it in next blog) were so beautiful that there were times when we didnt feel like going out of our resorts (but ofcourse we did). Besides these being such amazing properties, the staff used to be so sweet that you instantly feel at home and ofcourse they were quire value for money. Just to give you an idea, we spent 14 k per person for 11 nights stay which is quite cheap as per me.Global Royal PemuteranHotelsMap  \tThe Artini Resort HotelsMap  \t  \t  \tDay 55. For Enchanting waterfalls - Though i could only visit 2 due to paucity of time and the places we had to cover but Bali is full of unexplored waterfalls .Tegenungan WaterfallHotelsMapThere are more reasons than this but i guess i got to finish this blog here. GO to Bali for beautiful places, amazing people, great hospitality, yummy food and everything that you would ever want from a vacation.",

		"Text": "In a country, known as the Island of the Gods, made up of thousands of volcanic islands, this vibrant city in Indonesia is to perfectly describe &#x2013; Bewitching. Being unaware of the beauty that this world&#x2019;s largest island country holds, I decided to embark on this journey to experience and take in it all.Habituated to travelling since young and fulfilling travel dreams in India and the world, I usually travel prepared. Weeks of pursuing of what will interest me and finding the right sanctuary to dwell during my habitat period in Bali, I found myself planning a perfect little vacation. Only tip I can give to someone who enjoy being a traveler is to take in all you can from Bali. Bali is not just a place to visit, it&#x2019;s an experience you preserve for a lifetime.As days and weeks passed, and it was time to emplane. The flight descended towards Bali halting for few hours in Kuala Lumpur. The wait was exciting and full of turbulence. Hours later, maneuvering atop volcanic mountains, the greenery, the island, the ocean, your pilot makes sure you find yourself caught up in a europhoria. Being breathless for a while and came back to our senses once we started to descend. My exhilaration couldn&#x2019;t be explained to finally have step foot on this island.Deplaned and stamped we quickly grab our baggage, changed our currencies&#x2019; and rode towards our habitat. Picturesque city with architectural landmarks, locals adorning balineese traditional garments, tourists on scooters, you get to experience the age old culture and ancient beliefs with a modern hip twist on the way. Architectural Marvels of BaliEvery crossroads and traffic intersection in the city, footpaths, outside shops, women folk will pray and place offering known as the Canangs Sari. Made of leaves and filled with flowers, fruits, coins, and incense, it&#x2019;s a daily offering given to the spirits of the earth below.Balineese culture is combined and formed beautifully with balineese-hindu &#x2013; Buddhist religion. It is known for its creativity depicted in dance, drama and sculptures. Hinduism has a major influence over Bali from the very first century.Local people are the sweetest and donot hesitate to give respect and a smile wherever you go. Greetings like Good morning Selamat pagi (S&#x2019;LAH-maht PAH-ghee) Good afternoon Selamat siang (S&#x2019;LAH-maht PAH-ghee SEE-yang) Good evening Selamat sore (S&#x2019;LAH-maht PAH-ghee) follows you all day. You can always give back a Thank You Terima kasih (Tuh-REE-mah KAH-see) with a smile to these lovely folks.Le Grande, Pecatu -Nestled in the heart of Kuta, the western coast of Bali, is a grand sanctuary. Often a top spot for golf lovers and wedding events, 4 star hotel with all amenities, lush green walking paths with vibrant fishes swimming across the paths, hours can be spent in this habitat doing exactly what I do best &#x2013; Nothing.Le Grande, Pecatu on a rainy eveningBook yourself a Pecatu suite or deluxe balcony, each rooms styled in a contemporary Balinese style with a view. Book a spa and laze around while sipping your favorite cocktails and gorging on fresh fruits. Must Visit Places / Must Do&#x2019;s - \nMount BaturHotelsMapAn active volcano formed about 28,500 years ago, last erupted in 2000, is a must visit destination in Bali. Approximately 2 hours from our habitat in Kuta. You can enlive the scenic beauty by grabbing a seat at any local restaurant, sitting face to face with the volcano and enjoying a cold beer and a lavish buffet of local delicacies or if you are into trekking and looking for an adventure/off beat path, you can always opt of the Mount Batur sunrise trek which usually starts at very early in the morning and by the time trek ends you are on the volcano gleaming at the glistening first rays of the sunrise, enjoying boiled eggs made on the crater itself or the steaming holes of the caves.SeminyakHotelsMapAt the southern end of Bali lies this beautiful spot called Seminyak. Much laid-back in lifestyle than hip Kuta. From temples to boutique shopping and to find a beach which is quieter than rest of Bali this is the place. Check out the Petitenget Temple which is a local place of worship and to catch a beautiful sunset, Seminyak beach is a go.Uluwatu TempleHotelsMapDeriving from the words, &#x2018;lu&#x2019;, meaning &#x2018;lands&#x2019; end&#x2019;, and watu, meaning &#x2018;rock. It sits in the south-western tip of Bali. One of the surfing destinations due to the intensity of the waves which makes it a best surfing spot. Famous for the Uluwatu temple which is nestled on the cliff top. During sunset, you can sit back and enjoy the fire dance or monkey dance chanting a &#x2018;keh-chak&#x2019;. The dance is inspired by the story line from the Ramayana with balineese expressions. It usually starts at 6 in the evening.UbudHotelsMapThe cultural hub of Bali. Famous for textiles and handicrafts, this town is bundled amongst rice paddies and ravines. Streets filled with good restaurants overlooking the rice paddies, and you can always opt for pretty caf&#xE9;&#x2019;s and street shopping. Don&#x2019;t be bamboozled by the prices, you can always look for a better bargain. You can visit the Museum of art, monkey forest or walk about the streets looking for handicrafts made by the local artisans.Tanah Lot TempleHotelsMapIn the village of Beraban, rests the famous temple of Tanah Lot on a large offshore rock. You can walk over to the temple when tides are low, but foreigners/non-balineese people are not allowed to enter the temple.Remember to cover legs which is of outmost important while visitng any temple in Bali for both men and women &#x2013; a Kain Kamben (sarong) around your legs and a Selendang (temple scarf) around your waist. These items can be rented at temple entrances or you can carry your own.Bali Luwak Coffee Plantation OfficeHotelsMapA must try is the luwak coffee, aka Poop coffee. Just as the name suggests, made out of the poop of the luwak. Produced in the Indonesian island of Java, Bali, Sumatra, the luwak eats the cherries and the fermentation takes place in the digestive track, passed through the intestines and finally pooped out. The coffee cherries are then picked up and made into the poop coffee.Must Visit Beaches &#x2013;Crystal- Clear waters, salty air, ocean breeze and sunshine, beaches in Bali are to die for. To experience, Dreamland Beach, Karma Beach Club, Padang-Padang Beach, Sanur Beach, Nusa Penida, Uluwatu Beach are worth mentioning. To reach to a few of the beaches, you have to cross steep caves and monkeys and all the hurdles which will lead you to a paradise. Don&#x2019;t wait just pack your sunscreens and sarong and head to all of them.Padang-Padang BeachNightlife &#x2013;For party mongers or for someone looking to just sit back and relax on the beach, you got it all.Head to Jalan-Legion, Kuta and you will find streets filled with night clubs, music events and caf&#xE9;&#x2019;s. Party goes on till early morning. Number one mega club not to be missed is the Sky-Garden. One of Bali&#x2019;s premier night clubs which has 8 in-house pubs and club under the roof. Magical colourful drinks, beautiful people and vibrant energy will make this your favourite hot spot forever.If you want a pub with a legendary view, head over to Ayana&#x2019;s Rock Bar. Sitting on a secluded limestone cliff at the Jimbaran beach coast, it is one of the popular sunset destinations. Getting to rock bar is always an experience. You need to descend throw lawns and long staircases, which first provides the bird&#x2019;s eye view of the bar. On the way down you can enjoy the spectacular view and finally reach the bar on the cliff. Dress in Chic and grab a spot and go straight for the cocktails and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks while enchanting music plays in the background. The cold ocean breeze will relax and calm your mind while the poles set on fire near you will keep you warm.Rock Bar BaliHotelsMapBird&#x27;s eye view while descending to Rock BarOther popular destinations and things to do will include getting ready with your surf gear and hop aboard your motor and zoom off to surf at any beach where the tides are high, visiting temples, Having an array of seafood at the Jimbaran beach watching the colours of the sky change after sunset and laze around till night, muck diving, snorkelling, explore more paddy fields, bathe in the sacred waters at Tirta Empul, spend time with monkeys at the monkey forest, visit palaces and museums, drink from the fountain of youth at Goa Gajah, explore the cave under uluwatu beachJimbaran Bay Seafood ClubHotelsMapSea-Food Display at Jimbaran BayBali will appease to your appetite at all times, whether you are here to experience arts and history and only want to stick to museums and galleries and enjoy the dance or balineese culture or want to kick back and cycle around the rice paddy field meeting the locals and enjoying scrumptious local delicacies or want to stay on the beautiful beaches and get a golden tan or want to succumb to the nightlife that Bali has to offer.This is the place to be and to experience once in a lifetime.",

And then again it&apos;s one of those places where you don&apos;t mind being this tiny spec cos you are admiring the beauty and are in awe of this glory. Niagara is the perfect destination to enjoy long panoramic views of nature.. During summer, you can see multiple rainbows all at once with sunlight reflecting through the gallons of water. During winter, you can see the ice cracking and hear the winds howling. But nevertheless, Niagara never ceases to amaze you whatever the weather maybe. From April to October, you can take boat rides on the Maid of the mist/ Hornblower that take you as close to the horse shoe falls as possible. Enjoy the spray of the falls while you admire the beauty of this beast closely. Niagara has so much to offer and staying over at many of the inexpensive motels might not be a bad idea if you would like to explore a bit more than the falls. Things to do:1. The best part is a boat ride on Maid of the mist/ Hornblower. Nothing can beat this. 2. Jog behind the falls takes you literally behind the falls. You get to walk underneath the mighty Niagara and the loud pour of gallons of water over your head. The view is incredible. I know I use magnificent and incredible a lot but once you get there, you will know why. 3. White water rapids to experience the fury of the waters and the speed in which it travels. 4. There is zip lining near the the falls if you are into that sort of thing. You aren&apos;t very close to the falls but I guess another way to view the Niagara shouldn&apos;t be missed. It costs about $50 per person.5. There are loads of places to see from the giant wheel for a bird&apos;s eye view to the Ripley&apos;s believe it or not to the wax museum. 6. There is a massive park across the Niagara for a quick picnic or to read a novel. 7. Last but not the least if you enjoy photography, this place is for you.Niagara is that place that stays close to your heart once you visit it. Its not exactly in the heart of Toronto but a must visit. You won&apos;t be sorry.

		"Text": "Firsts are usually the most memorable experiences of all; and probably the most beautiful ones too. You always cherish the fond memories of falling in love for the first time, that first date or finally embracing the love of your dreams after all those years - or, in my case, the first visa on my passport, that too for the country I had only dreamed of visiting till then!! I believe I can be forgiven for drawing that parallel, since that was the start of my affair with traveling and travel photography after all. Ever since I left the little island nation all those years ago, Tokyo still captures my imagination - pulling me towards itself and enticing me to walk through its mysterious, intriguing and fascinating streets, where fiction and fantasy still reside. Anybody who has spent a few nights in Tokyo will vouch for the indelible impression that this city leaves on the minds of its visitors. All it takes is to muster that courage to walk right into the world of fantasies and culture you all grew up listening to and spend those two nights to experience the best of Tokyo - Day 1\nMeiji JinguHotelsMapNow that&#x27;s what you call an entrance - Meiji Jingu shrine (c)Michal PechardoAs you wake up feeling fresh after a long flight into Tokyo, your first experience of warm Japanese hospitality at the bus ticket window, or the cab you took to your accommodation, probably still lingers at the back of your mind. But you need to get off your feet quickly, since Tokyo has got so much to treat you with. As you get to terms with the bustling and overwhelming metropolis that Tokyo is, head to the west of the city and walk right into the heart of the Japanese culture and history - the Meiji Shrine. This is one of Japan&apos;s biggest and highly regarded Shinto shrines and is located a short walk from Harajuku station. This simple yet strikingly fascinating shrine is probably not as colorful as other Buddhist shrines you will come across in Tokyo, but is beautifully serene nonetheless.While you are in this part of Tokyo, you cannot help but stand in awe at millions of pedestrians doing their clockwork routine of navigating through the busiest street crossing in the world, just as you step out of Shibuya subway station. Having found its place in many Hollywood movies, this surreal experience has to be experienced once to truly appreciate the magnitude of this phenomenon.Get ready to face the human tsunami - organized one, that is!! (c)Fabian MardiAhh....and don&apos;t forget to notice the statue of Hachiko, the dog, just outside the Shibuya station. Needless to say, like most things in Japan this one has a really interesting story behind it too - let&apos;s keep this as a homework for you!!HarajukuHotelsMapIn stark contrast to the serene ambiance of Meiji is the vibrant hot-spot of Kawai culture in Japan - Harajuku. Located a few minutes away, this area is extremely popular among youngsters and fashion enthusiasts. Indulge in a shopping spree here, starting from Takeshita Dori to Omotesando, also called the Champs-Elysees of Tokyo. A short visit through these streets should bring you up to date with the uniquely vibrant fashion and Japanese youths culture that is renown worldwide.Latest and cutting edge, just how Japanese youths like their fashion to be - Harajuku (c)Ivy BarnKabukichoHotelsMapAs your first day in Tokyo comes to an end, spend the evening in this flashy and notorious Red Light district in Tokyo. From regular entertainment options for eateries, bars, karaoke and nightclubs to exclusive and unique experiences of Love Hotels, this is the place to unwind after a tiring day of traveling an choose your indulgence from plethora of options available here.The right place to make all your wishes come true. (c)Manuel CosentinoHead to the tiny street of Golden Gai, which is lined up with tiny bars and restaurants - after all the perfect way to end the day is with Japanese cuisines and a pint of local liquor.Day 2Tsukiji MarketHotelsMapStart your day with an early morning visit to arguably the largest seafood market in the world. It is an absolute paradise for every sea-food lover, with the freshest samples of regular to the most exotic of seafood on display to cater to your taste-buds. Needless to say, this is the place to have your authentic Japanese sushi experience.Allow the fresh seafood treat you to an exciting day aheadSensō-jiHotelsMapNext, head right into the aesthetically magnificent and serene Buddhist temple of Sensoji. This vibrant temple is at the heart of the Buddhist influence reflected in Japanese culture and is the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Enter through the main gate, Kaminarimon Gate and shop for beautiful souvenirs from Nakamise Dori. The five-storied pagoda at the main hall is a breathtaking spectacle, which is sure to leave an impression on any traveler&apos;s mind.Five-layered authentic Japanese Cultural flavor - Sensoji Temple (c)VincentUeno Onshi ParkHotelsMapFor a metropolitan boasting the population density as Tokyo, the city has some of the most beautiful parks and gardens in the world, strewn all along. Ueno Onshi is one of the most beautiful example of popular and spectacular parks in Tokyo. This expansive stretch of green is also home to Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum for Western Art, the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum and the National Science Museum, making it an ideal place for people interested in taking a peek into Japanese history.Let&#x27;s just take a breather here, shall we?

		"Text": "Day 1YuksomHotelsMapMountains are magnets...Gigantic black rocks at the top covered with white snow reminds your worth in front of nature and humbles you for others. Its serene beauty will bound you to skip blinking your eyes and give your heartbeats a ride. After almost a week long trek and close encounter with Kanchenjunga in Phalut i was not able to get over of that view. I felt like the mountain was attracting me towards itself , then i decided to get even a closer view of Kanchenjunga and hence i chose &quot;Pelling&quot; , the closest well settled city near Kanchenjunga. This is the best place where you can get a clear view of the Mountain from. I was in Yuksom to enquire for Goecha la trek and stay there was not very pleasant as it kept raining all day. Though i had my work done so i decided to go for Pelling as i thought to explore Yuksom other time when i come for Goecha La trek, now the mountain was calling me and i had to leave.From Yuksom only two taxis leaves on a particular time for Geyzing which costs arounds 300 INR . I reached Geyzing by 4 PM and then changed the transport for Pelling . Frequent taxis are available from Pelling which will cost 50 Rs per head on shared basis. It took another half an hour to reach Pelling from Geyzing. It was raining in Pelling like anything and i was worried of the weather because i missed Yuksom too.Pelling CityPellingHotelsMapI took a cheap room which costed me around 350 INR but it had a clear view of Kanchenjunga from the room. And here is the view.The Kanchenjunga extension at eveningSince it was too late reaching Pelling i roamed around the city after rain stopped for a while and enjoyed the fish curry and rice in restaurant and went to bed by 9 PM. Next morning i was so excited to catch the morning view of Kanchenjunga and explore Pelling. And i was not disappointed.I enquired about the nearby places and since i had only day i decided to explore Pelling as much as possible on my own. First on my list was to get even closer and clearer view of Kanchenjunga and Helipad of Pelling is known for it. So after morning breakfast headed straight to Helipad and it indeed is one of the Place where you can get one of the best view of Kanchenjunga. The pic of Kanchenjunga on 100 Rs note must have been taken from here.&quot;Once again Kanchenjunga has called me and i&apos;m here with all my will to be&quot; . After spending couple of hours and enjoying the serenity, it was time to leave the place and explore further Pelling. The next on my list was Sangachoeling Monastery built by Lhatsun Chenpo in the 17th century . It is one of the most beautiful monasteries of the world situated in the lap of Kanchenjunga.The monastery was being renovated when i was there but still had all the spirits of spirituality in it. Best place for meditation with best view of Kanchenjunga. I stayed there and meditated in front of the mountain with all the senses of silence and storm in my mind and with my favourite downtempo on i felt the world as the best place to be in.Kachenjunga and the spirituality goes hand in handKanchenjunga as seen from Sangha Choeling MonasteryAfter some meditation i saw two Lamas chilling in the Sun, since i wanted to go inside the Monastery i asked them permission and they said no need to ask. I asked about them, then i came to know that one of them was the head of the Monastery. They explained me the history of the Monastery . After having a nice conversation i asked them permission to leave and went inside the monastery all alone. There was no one inside but i felt some presence inside the main temple. It was a dream come true for me being inside a monastery all alone. I had a good time observing the temple though i couldn&apos;t take pictures as it was not permitted though there was no one to really see you but God.The Lamas at MonasteryLamas do there work themselves.After getting all around view of the Monastery i left the place with joy and happiness but it was already 4 PM by now and i was hungry. I came back to the same restaurant and had good tight Lunch. By that time it was evening. I roamed around the town took some pictures did some shopping and stayed outside for as long as possible before going to bed.Next day i had to leave early but waiting for the bus didn&apos;t seem to be a good option for me so i hired the same taxi in reserve for 250 Rs that got me till Geyzing on time and fortunately was able to catch my flight back to bangalore.Places to see around Pelling are, 1. Sangha Choeling Monastery 2. Helipad 3. Pemayangtse Monastery 4. Rabdentse Ruins 5.Kanchenjunga Waterfall 6. Darap VillageHow to reach Pelling? Take shared taxi from Gangtok, Jorethang to Geyzing or directly Pelling. Geyzing is best local place for connectivity.Where to stay in Pelling? Rabdentse Residency",

		"Text": "December 2016. Spent: Rs. 5000 /- per person for 3 days &amp; 3 nights. It included:Bus journey from Mumbai to Hospet and return. Booked a semi recliner from Goibibo for approx Rs. 1200 per person one way.Breakfast x2 and dinner x2 at the guest house. Lunch x2 at the Mango Tree.Auto cost Rs. 2500 /- for sightseeing in Hampi and transport to and from Hospet.We were 3 travelers who boarded a bus from Mumbai, India at 7pm to Hospet, Karnataka and reached Hospet at 8AM the next day.At Hospet, several auto guys were waiting for their rented rides. One of them offered us to take to Hampi ( 10km ride ) for Rs. 320 /- for all 3 ( we could have negotiated more).HospetHampi has two parts. We reached Tungabhadra river which divides Hampi in these 2 parts. One side has all the temples and ruins, the other is more of an accommodation area.Tungabhadra RiverWe took a ferry ( Rs. 10 without luggage , Rs. 30 with luggage) to cross this river. It took us minute in the ferry and 10 minutes for it to be filled with people.We had booked our guesthouse - Waterfall Guesthouse. 3 of us paid a total of Rs. 1200 /- per night for basic amenities - a room where 3-4 people can sleep, free wi-fi, an in built toilet and bathroom. A group of 3 came the next day and got a similar room and same facilities at Rs. 750 /- per night for 3. They were backpackers. We had booked it a month prior (you can negotiate). There were cheaper rooms available which had common toilets and bathrooms. The owner - Mr Ramu spoke good English and hence there was no communication problem. His contact number is +91 9482786942. He had sent an auto rickshaw guy to pick us up once we crossed the river. The auto cost was included in the amount we paid for the rooms. It was a 3-4 km drive from the river.There was many foreigners who stayed there. There were people from Russia, a family from Iran etc.The menu had several and delicious variety in meals. They had 4-5 cuisine options. Average rate for a pasta was Rs. 200 /- , sandwich Rs. 100, coffee Rs. 20 etc.Our jaws dropped once we reached the place.Waterfall guesthouse - Dining area.As we were on a budget trip, we carried our breakfast, had it here and left quickly to venture around!We hired scooter from here. Rs. 150 /- per day rent + Rs. 90/- for a liter of fuel. 3 of us sat on this beast and left to explore the other side i.e. the guesthouse side of the river.They didn&apos;t allow triple seat because it would damage the scooter. But since, 2 of us didn&apos;t know how to ride a scooter, they let us hire it on a condition to not damage it.Check other accommodation options. Waterfall Guesthouse photos. We stopped by at The Stone Bridge.The Stone BridgeOur next stop was Lord Hanuman&apos;s birth place - Anjaneya Hill. It was 575 step trek. Carry shades, scarf and water along. Beware of the monkeys. There are a few stalls to drink water / tender coconut water and eatables too. There is no washroom.Do stop by here for a break. A very windy place with shade.A very interesting staircase after crossing 500 steps. A breathtaking view from the top of Anjaneya Hill. ( Photos ) We saw a specimen of a stone from the Ram Setu!!! Unfortunately, photography wasn&apos;t allowed in the temple.For those who don&apos;t know what it is - According to the Indian Mythology - Ramanayana, Ram Setu is a bridge that was built by the Vanar Sena - monkeys of Lord Rama from Tamil Nadu till Sri lanka to get his wife Sita back from Raavana.We left Anjaneya Hil and stopped by on the way at a scenic spot to click photos. Next, we went home, had lunch and chilled.Around 5 we left for out next spot for coracle boating in a Tungabhadra tributary. Our experience was enhanced because the rower got happier seeing our happiness! He enjoyed his job a lot! He charged 3 of us Rs. 300 for 30 minutes. We had planned to go there during sunset and it was the most sane and brilliant decision.Coracle Boat rideBreathtaking sunset\nDay 2HampiHotelsMapToday we took an auto from our guesthouse to the river front for Rs. 150 /- for 3 of us. Then took a ferry to reach the other side - Rs. 10 /- per person. We met our auto driver - Coffee. Yes, his name is Coffee. He says his name is difficult to remember. Same driver who picked us up at Hospet. He charged us more and didn&apos;t know many things when we asked him questions ( he claimed that he is a guide cum driver) and hence not sharing his number. We made a mistake of not asking around and checking the auto prices for 1-2 days. There were drivers who were willing to take people around for sightseeing for Rs. 400-500 /- day.On this side of the river there are cycles on rent too. Approx Rs.100-200 per day. We chose an auto because of 32&#xB0;C. We didn&apos;t want to exhaust ourselves.First stop was post office to send post cards to our loved ones because Hampi stamp. We left for our our second stop was Vitthala temple. On the way we stopped at &quot; Weapons Check point&quot;  My most awaited stop- Vitthala temple. The monument opens from 8.30 in the morning to 5.30 in the evening. The entry cost for 3 places ( Vithala temple, Lotus Mahal and Elephant stable) was Rs. 90 /- per person. All 3 to be visited in one day only. From the auto stand, there is a cart which takes passengers to the temple. Since it is a 1-2 km walk, I&apos;d suggest walk it up till the temple because on the way there are beautiful stops which are not to be missed. While returning, take the cart because you&apos;ll be exhausted after the temple visit. It takes good 2 hours minimum to see this beauty.I am standing near the sides of the entrances. These sides again are huge!Entrance to Vitthala TempleAn underground area where the light comes when there is sunlight which reflects from the water near our feet ! Stunning architecture !Figuring out how to play these instruments aka pillars :PPosing near the musical temples.These temples have 56 musical pillars. Each pillar emits a SOUND OF DIFFERENT MUSICAL INSTRUMENT when tapped!! How fascinating is it??Read more here and here. Watch this magic here.I&apos;d suggest if you have come money to spare, take a guide. He&apos;ll be the best person to explain the rich culture and history here. We were just eavesdropping everywhere.Our next stop was Lotus Mahal, Light house and Elephant stables.We ventured around in the vicinity and returned home since it would take us an hour and the ferry&apos;s last ride is at 6 pm.Day 3HampiHotelsMapAfter bidding farewells to all the warm people in the guesthouse, we left for our third day adventure.We went for an adventurous trek on Mathanga Hills. It consumed 2 hours.I couldn&#x27;t go more. I waited for my friends here with the company of these massive boulders, birds, imaginary stories and weak internet.A bird&#x27;s eye view of Vitthala temple which I missed. An ant :P in front of this humongous boulder Next stop was Sasivekalu Ganesha temple , Hazara Rama Temple , Underground Shiva Temple, Krishna Temple, Queen&apos;s Bath , Pushkaranis, broken doors and finally Virupaksha Temple.Hazara Rama Temple is the only place which had black marble.Pushkarni.An olden times plateDining area of gathering of people for functions - plates made of stones ! On day 2 &amp; 3 we had lunch at Mango Tree. There were plethora of options for cuisine. We had Rajasthani Thali, Pita bread bread, hummus, fries, nutella pancake and mango milkshake. We really enjoyed the food.We did a little shopping at Hampi Bazaar. There were lot of new options for jewelry ranging from Rs. 100 - 300 /- . A request to my readers to not bargain for Rs. 20-30 /-. Such small denomination makes a big deal to them.We reached Hospet at 5pm and witnessed another fascinating sunset. Finally asked Coffee, our auto driver&apos;s name. It was Anand! Yeah I know ! So wannabe ! *rolls eyes*. Our bus left at 6:30 pm. Next day at 8:30, we reached Chembur, Mumbai with lot of memories.In case you have more days to look around visit this website for planning. This too.",

Located along the Nile River Valley, Banana Island (Gezira el-Mozh) attracts visitors with its small banana plantation and local food.Wander about leisurely on the Island leaving all the hustle of the city behind. It is an ideal place to end a hectic and hot day exploring with a peaceful sense of cool breezes and flowing waters of Nile.Beautiful coast of Musandam, OmanIf you have to search for the best cliff jumping or cannoning holiday destinations then Wadi in Musandam would be your top search result. They are deep, immense, and dramatic with natural splendor. The shaded Siqs, numerous waterfalls chaperone you throughout the day from hot summers. Hiking is more fun at Musandam as you get a chance to explore hidden landscape of canyons that wind down from the high plateau of the eastern desert into the Wadi Araba, plenty of water springs and hanging gardens, dense vegetation and a lot more.Kadisha Valley, LebanonThis place marvels at spectacular scenery carved by the Kadisha River. The Valley comprises the largest number of monasteries and hermitages dating back to the very first spread of Christianity. The entire valley is covered with terraced fields brimming with olive and fruit trees, and picturesque stone houses.  Hike the hillsides at the base of the valley and see what it feels like getting covered by an ocean of clouds.The Treasury, Petra (Jordan)Petra, the Nabataean caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea, is one of the world&apos;s most famous archaeological sites surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. The city has managed to &apos;wow&apos; the world with its beautiful rose colored stone, elaborate stone-cut architecture and natural patterns created by water conduits.Petra&#x2019;s most celebrated monument is the Treasury.

The surprising fact is although there is no source of water in sigh, this mesquite tree is known for holding a great deal of water in its enormous root system. This makes Bahrain&#x2019;s Tree of Life even more mysterious. The mystery of this lonesome tree has captivated locals and non-locals for centuries; today it is one of the Bahrain&#x2019;s top tourist attractions, adorning souvenir mugs and drawing visitors from all around the world to this barren part of the country.",

North Goa has many beaches to visit compare to south Goa. But some beaches of South Goa are mesmerizing and beautiful .What is the best thing about beaches? Is it the sweltering sun rays that fall straight on the sea bed, the sparkling sand that covers the entire beach area or the incredibly beautiful sea that cover almost 71 percent of the Earth surface? Well, it is a combination of all three of them, which perk up the beauty of beaches in India and make them look naturally appealing. India is gifted with some of the best beaches in the world spread across the coastal lines of Southern India.What is that you like the most about &#x2018;Goa&#x2019;? The long and crowded stretch of beaches, late night parties, tasty cuisines, or the water sports activities. Goa has everything to satisfy the hungry beach lovers. It also has some very serene beaches for people who like to stay away from the beach side hustle and bustle.First, we visited Agonda Beach . It is located at a distance of 4-5 kms from Stone Water Eco Resort(we stayed here). It is an isolated stretch of sealine located on the outskirts of Goa that helps you to relax amid natural wonders like , soft warm sand and turquoise blue water. It has plenty of beach side accommodations, mostly huts for tourists to relax and enjoy the stillness of nature. Agonda is gaining popularity lately and a lot of hotels, souvenir stalls, and restaurants are coming up in site. It is undoubtedly one of the best beaches in Goa.Looking for a place to relax, relax, and relax? Palolem Beach is where you can go! This exotic piece of nature is the most beautiful site located in South Goa,Enclosed by thick coconut palms and surrounded by clear sea blue water, the picturesque Palolem Beach is undeniably the state&#x2019;s most beautiful beach. Mostly covered with beach huts, boats and fish nets, this beautiful sealine stretches across miles and looks shady and semi-circle shaped with diverse variety of flora. This beautiful beach spot offers different atmospheres to diverse tourists- It has the most serene and prestine north stretch for quieter and laid back people, crowded and action-packed beach center for families and backpackers, and party filled south zone for hippies and partygoers. Other than this, people can indulge in dolphin spotting, fishing, boat riding, shopping, and massaging activities at Palolem Beach.This was one of the unforgettable memory. With this trip, we enjoyed the beautiful experience and charm of this land of lovely beaches. Portuguese-style churches and exciting surroundings are the reasons why it gets packed with many people during most part of the year.",

I dropped my bike twice on the way to Killar. My bike got 03 punctures on the way. First after crossing Baralacha La, second on the same day at top of Lachung La at 16000 ft. at around 19:00Hrs and last on the way to Tso-Moriri. And our dear friend Aman who made every body laugh and sometimes irritate met with an unfortunate accident (shoulder and rib fracture) and spent 03 months on the bed.The most amazing part &#x2013; While on the bed, he was discussing with me the next year plans. I told him that you first heal your bones and then we will discuss. He replied &#x201C;I still have 364 full bones left.&#x201D; Hats off to the spirit.We were all touched by Bairagarh beauty, we did the toughest route and toughest Sach Pass, stayed at the most beautiful Cherry Bungalow, have the most relaxing time in Leh- we just ate, enjoyed and slept for continuously 03 days like a spoiled brat, learned how to properly fix a puncture in the shortest time (fixing bullet puncture not an easy job esp. in cold), witnessed two beautiful hidden lakes, rode on the highest pass (for us) Kaksang La (Actual height- 17,842 ft.) between Mahe (40km, 4,200m) and Chushul which is more than my previous Chang La and Khardung La, we had many beautiful moments, awe-inspiring landscape, one of a kind journey and an adventure that you cannot beat.",

We all came to know each other and become more familiar with each other.Then dinner time came, we stopped at highway restaurant and took some photos.After dinner, felt more energetic and started our journey. Now we all are very active and our dinner time helps to know each other more better. Fun time started for us and we randomly started dancing in our bus for multi-language Songs. The dance shows goes for around 3 hours minimum i guess and i have repeated the same steps for all the hours and happy that my friends accepted it without boring. After this most of them were slept and i didn&apos;t get a proper sleep.Reached shivamoga and teasted the shivamoga special &quot;idli&quot; at 4.30 AMShivmaoga Special IDLISleepless nite but love to travel with my playlist on my fav seat..Day 2We reached our homestay around 7 am and the kodachadri welcomes us with rain.

		"Text": "The Chenab\nDay 1New DelhiHotelsMapI have picked up my pen to write for pleasure again. a semester had intervened in between. My writing seems stilted to me, my thoughts disjointed. Still, I&apos;ll have to write to get over the debris blocking the flow. I am on my way to Manali, and then hopefully, beyond, to the Spiti Valley, a solo trip. And I&apos;m unsure whether to rejoice in my solitariness, or feel sad about my loneliness. And I realize it completely is my choice. I will have decided by the end of this 14 hour bus ride, surely.It is amusing to look back on the 20 years of my life, replay parts of various journeys, and feel again what those snapshots, snatches of conversations, glimpses of tracks branching away hold for you.So many people to observe. Co-passengers, people in passing cars, truck drivers. So many different lives. Wouldn&apos;t it be interesting to get to talk to them all, for even 5 minutes? Get them to talk about their lives till you met them? Might help you get your own life into perspective. Not a complete perspective, but at least wider than the current one, maybe?This will be a good journey, I feel. I can&apos;t base my feelings on evidence, but the words yet to be written hold the future.Humans are a cruel lot. How they&apos;ve kept on chipping away at the surface of the Earth. They haven&apos;t even slept nights since they can control light. Toiling, toiling away at their own destruction. Accelerating towards a fall that&apos;ll just about wipe them off. There&apos;s an almost full moon shining through the bus windows, mist over the foothills. Or is it just smoke? Ghoulish humans driving trucks and buses all over the once virgin mountain forests. Abuse. Abuse of our existence. Abuse by our own efforts, because we don&apos;t know when to stop. Where do we end? When are we ending?Travelling solo is nice. It&apos;s maturing. It makes you talk to strangers. It makes you break your own inhibitions. There is no family to look around for. You are your own family up here, and some new acquaintances who mean well.Day 2Old ManaliHotelsMapSolitary. In a forest. With nothing with me but thousands of living, breathing, creaking trees. Giants. Magnificent behemoths. And of course, my conscious. Haven&apos;t spoken except in monosyllables since morning. Wouldn&apos;t it have been wonderful if there had been another to be silent with? Maybe not, unless there had been tremendous love as the binding force. I think I am capable of loving again. With that unstoppable, tumbling, rumbling, continuosly growing motion of life that comes with it. But is someone ready for that? Will she turn away in that force? Afraid of losing what binds her to others? Will she be able to come to me?Old ManaliHotelsMapI hear music all around. Guitars, Ukuleles, singing. The people here are so different with their viewpoint about life. Beautiful music. Music that makes you lose yourself. I wonder why can&apos;t so easily lose myself into anything. This whole place is so alive. Not that I am dead. But here is a community which might be, or very probably would be ostracized in the cities. In the &quot;normal&quot; society. And here they&apos;re so accepted. So natural in their high, in their music. I wonder if I&apos;m just too self conscious to have anything to do with a community. Like minded people. Or maybe I just haven&apos;t found them.Day 3Gramphu-Batal-Kaza RoadHotelsMapThis journey has been wonderful till now. Today was amazing. Eye-popping. Exhilarating. Humongous. Manali to Kaza. A 14 hour journey. There are almost proper roads till Rohtang La. After that it&apos;s just mountains cut away. 1&#xBD; lanes, or less, never more. A truck punctured two tires somewhere between Gramphu and Rohtang. Tourists and locals alike had to gather rocks to build a road to allow vehicles to pass. Pretty amazing experiences. What I write is hardly doing justice to what happened. I&apos;m tired, maxed out. Can&apos;t form proper sentences to actually convey what everything adds up to. This experience, this whole journey, I&apos;ll never be able to completely put into words for another to feel. I wish. Maybe some photos might make you understand how overpowering these Himalayas are. How towering. Up here, the roads are twirling around the feet of the ranges. The peaks are actually rising up from where you stand. I can&apos;t, I can&apos;t do this. I can&apos;t write about this. You have to be here. Looking up. Looking around. And feel how futile it is to try and capture this in photos. How your endless gazing is not enough. Never will be. These mountains are going to stand long after the human race has killed itself off. New life will start again. And over. This is the force.Near Batal, SpitiKunzum PassHotelsMapYou make such unusual friendships, and passing connections. Connections which are so deep. But so transient because you are moving along different ways. She was beautiful. She who looked straight into my eyes. No pretense. If I hadn&apos;t had an insistent honking from my own vehicle, I&apos;d have stayed back there. Now I wish I had. But that&apos;s just my over-emotional childish thought. On a journey, you never get held back. Never get attached. Never stay back. That&apos;s for a different kind of living. I will just cherish the memory, and live on. We&apos;re probably, most probably, never going to see each other ever again. Ever. We don&apos;t know names, we&apos;re just two people who bonded for a half hour on a 14 hour journey. This is life on the road. Inshallah, we&apos;ll meet again.Day 5Key GompaHotelsMapSo we did meet again. This day has been the best since I started off. Maybe. I really can&apos;t compare actually. But today was good. There&apos;s an Australian, a Swiss, two Israelis, a Spaniard and one from Delhi. (Sounds like an inventory, sorry) Quite a mix of people. I am not even trying to express how I am feeling inside. There&apos;s elation, there&apos;s surprise, there&apos;s joy! This is happiness, which I hardly ever feel back in Delhi. This is happiness, which makes you want to live so much more. You do not want to jump off a cliff, or get under a bus. This is happiness, here is peace. I am in love(?), with this place, with the situation.This all feels like a dream. Or rather the life I&apos;ve left back in the city feels like an illusion, a thing that can stop existing any moment I choose to. But this, here, this can never not be. I wonder how it&apos;ll feel like to go back to that world of the constant noise, continuous internet connectivity, and unseeing people. Till then, the days here at the Key Monastery.Day 8KazaHotelsMapI dare not write about the feelings I am having on my way back. That, is better not delved into. All I can say is, I will keep coming back here, to places like this. To all the journeys like these.Key GompaHotelsMapView Of the Spiti Valley from a Mountain trail behind Key Gompa",

		"Text": "Day 1New DelhiHotelsMap&quot;Meditation is not an act, it&apos;s a state to be in.&quot;For the readersI am writing this blog just as a seeker, as someone who has eventually developed that strong urge to explore beyond the physical world . I am not a follower of any particular spiritual ideology or Guru ji as such , though I respect them all.I will be sharing my experience as what exactly I felt at Sadhguru&#x2019;s Isha Yoga Centre and will try answering questions which generally bother people on this journey &#x2013; Is there really something Divine there ? Will you automatically start meditating there for hours ? Is there any undesired commercialization ? etc.#Since Photography was allowed only at selected areas inside Isha Yoga Centre, some of the photographs published here have therefore been sourced online .I am grateful to these parent sources.Why Sadhguru ?Talking of Spirituality, for most of the beginners, it all commences with the excitement of knowing the unknown and this mystic infatuation for Meditation /Spirituality stays for few days before one switches attention to something new ,something more exciting as the Meditation just doesn&#x2019;t seem to work despite best efforts and hence one very conveniently concludes &#x2013; &quot;Life is anyways short , just go with the flow &amp; enjoy your Pizza mate.&quot; I &amp; the people around me too thought that I will go down the same lane.But it didn&apos;t happen that way ! Here I was at Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev&#x2019;s Aashram, after an year full of lengthy discussions ,some deep digging in books/write ups and watching lot of videos all related to this quest of &#x2018;Going beyond the Physical World&#x2019;.As stated at the onset ,I am not associated with any particular spiritual group/institution as such and I will probably be happy to keep it that way , but of all the people that I heard,I read and I saw on various platforms, I was invariably drawn towards Sadhguru for whatever he talked , every single word just made so much sense.And after going through a few books of Sadhguru , I decided to take a leap of faith, which took me straight to Sadhguru&#x2019;s Energy Centre.Isha FoundationHotelsMapFirst Few hoursNamaskaram Anna ! These polite words welcomed me as I entered the beautiful premises of the Isha Yoga Centre , Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev&#x2019;s Meditation Centre at Coimbatore.Help desk people at the main entrance were really very helpful and they quickly completed all the formalities and handed over an ID card which read &#x2018;Nadhi&#x2019; (Cottage) besides my name .On my way to my room at Nadhi cottage, I could feel the extremely soothing vibes as everyone there was so calm and smiling. After checking into my room, I immediately rushed through the instruction leaflet kept at desk, which had all the information about various activities that go on all throughout the day at the center along with the map.Being fortunate and unfortunate Soon after checking in , I got to know that it was Poornima (Full Moon Night) that day and hence a special pooja was scheduled in the evening at Linga Bhairavi temple inside the premises only.Hearing that I felt really happy with the thought of participating in a special Pooja which I was not even aware of .Sadhguru&#x2019;s Magic Rahul ,Sadhguru&#x2019;s Magic &#x2013; I whispered to myself.And since nothing could have gone wrong that day, so out of utmost excitement, I asked the obvious question ,&quot;Will I meet Sadhguru ? Will he be there ?&quot;&quot;No Anna&quot;, said the help desk guy very politely , &quot;Though Sadhguru is in the Aashram today but yesterday only he met everyone at Satsang and since his diary is full of meetings/work assignments planned about months ago ,so your meeting looks unlikely.&quot;Sad I felt .But since there were still 3 more days to go ,so I was still little hopeful.Amidst all such thoughts ,I headed straight to Linga Bhairavi Temple.Actually ,when you reach Isha Yoga Centre, your eyes just keep on looking for the two popular mystic energy spots- The Linga Bhairavi Temple &amp; of-course ,the energy epitome Dhyanalinga besides the latest attraction- the 112 ft Adiyogi&#x2019;s Statue (unrelieved by Honorable Prime Minister recently ) . One wishes to be there as quickly as possible &amp; preferably at all the three spots at the same time which, at least as of now is definitely beyond my capabilities(but with Meditation,you never know).Such is the excitement ,especially after having read a lot about that mystic meditative energy around these spots.Will talk of the Linga Bhairavi Temple first !Day 2Linga BhairaviHotelsMapLinga Bhairavi TempleAround 7 pm ,on my way to Linga Bhairavi temple for special pooja , I crossed Dhyanalinga which was a little distant though. .As so much was happening within my 1st hour at centre , so my thoughts almost froze and I was just witnessing everything ,including Dhyanlinga without any judgement or feel,kind of numb you can say.As I reached The Linga Bhairavi Temple , hundred of illuminating Ghee (Clarified Butter) lamps greeted me.It all looked so spectacular that I literally didn&#x2019;t bat an eyelid for few seconds.As everyone calmly sat down and took their position, Pooja &amp; Mantra chants started and I was actually feeling a rush of energy sitting there.Linga Bhairavi , in the words of Sadhguru, is an extremely powerful feminine energy form which is very responsive for people seeking prosperity and well being.But there is spiritual side to Linga Bhairavi Devi as well. Infact, as per information that I gathered there from various people, people who find it difficult to mediate even when sitting right in front of Dhyanalinga, they are advised to first spend some time at Linga Bhairavi temple as the energy there helps you to focus ,especially during very initial days of meditation.DhyanalingaDhyanalingaHotelsMapDhyanalinga ,again in the words of Sadhguru, is largest mercury based living linga (a form or a symbol )in the world which is the centre of infinite energy.In spiritual terms, at Dhyanalinga ,all aspects of life have been woven in the form of seven chakras energized to peak and locked by Sadhguru after 3 years of intense process Prana Prathistha.Dhyanalinga is enshrined in a dome shaped structure full of earth colour and natural stone and is infact considered as the best spot to meditate by the centre inmates , where the energy of Dhyanlinga is said to naturally aide you in your Dhyan ( other name for Sadhna or Meditation).So much has been said &amp; written about the unbound energy around Dhyanalinga that for many, including myself , Dhyanalinga is the primary reason to visit Isha Yoga Centre, atleast for the first time.AdiyogiAdiyogi StatueHotelsMapNeedless to say , Shiva is among the most popular and widely worshiped Indian God but after going through some of the articles on how exactly talks about Meditation /Yoga started ,including few of Sadhguru&#x2019;s write ups, I got to know that in Yogic Culture,Shiva is not known as God but as a first Yogi &#x2013; the originator of yoga and as the first Guru (teacher) who actually experienced what we call &#x2018;The Enlightenment&#x2019; for the first time and it is from there that discussions about Enlightenment,Yoga ,Sadhna etc started among Humans.Hence ,as a mark of respect and as a reminder to the world to move towards liberation through exploring inner instead of outer world , Sadhguru has consecrated the 112 ft. tall face of Adiyogi which was unveiled by Honourable Prime Minister recently.While I didn&#x2019;t find anyone meditating in front or around Adiyogi&#x2019;s huge face , but there was hardly anyone visiting Isha Yoga centre &amp; not spending 5-10 minutes in the Adiyogi&#x2019;s vicinity.Day 3Isha FoundationHotelsMapTeerthakund &#x2013; SuryaKund &amp; ChandraKundThere are two Teerthakunds or the sacred water pools for purifying oneself within the Dhyanalinga complex &#x2013; SuryaKund for men and Chandrakund for the women.I,obviously, am aware of details of Suryakund only which in itself looks like a divine water pool with three Shivalinga&#x2019;s immersed in water.Ideally, men are supposed to take a bath at Suryakund before going for meditation at Dhyanalinga or Linga Bhairavi temple.On the first day, I went there just for the sake of adventure but thanks to the energy that i felt there, I could not help but take the holy bath again &amp; again,even just before check out.The Strong Presence of King CobraIrrespective of where you are at Isha Yoga Centre, whatever direction you are facing , you can very strongly feel the presence of Snakes (read king cobra) in various forms &#x2013; be it on lamps, on walls, on pillars, at SuryaKund,at DhyanaLinga . On inquiring I got to know that Sadhguru consider snakes,especially King Cobra as the most sensitive animal/reptile when it comes to Meditative energy. Sadhguru has also mentioned about this in his book Mystic Musings.Besides, since the Velliangiri Hills, where Isha Yoga Centre is situated , is reportedly home to king Cobras.Since they are the original inhabitants of the place, so in a way Sadhguru has paid tribute to them.Luckily , I too spotted a beautiful water snake, live one, swimming his way through lotus in the pool in between Nandi &amp; SuryaKund.My experienceFirst thing first, of all the locations/energy spots at Isha Yoga Centre mentioned above , Linga Bhairavi temple definitely needs another mention as I spent maximum time there , not exactly by choice though. I mean there is something really very magnetic over there, something very soothing and very very positive which just keeps on pulling you towards itself and you just can&#x2019;t resist going there.Sitting right in front of Linga Bhairavi Devi, I could actually meditate for the longest time. More than the duration, its the feeling that engulfed me while Meditating there.On one hand I was kind of blank,absolute calm while at the same very time I could feel extreme joy and the unfamiliar sort of power from within.Till the last day, I could not get enough of meditation at Linga Bhairavi Temple.That mystic feeling is still there with me.As for the Dhyanalinga , I had read so much about it before going to Coimbatore that I had almost made up my mind in advance that as and when I will sit around Dhyanalinga , I will feel something out of the world,something really divine.But , honestly &amp; unfortunately , I didn&#x2019;t feel anything of that sort there. Yes, the whole ambiance around Dhyanalinga is very peaceful and calm with everyone sitting in Sadhna completely in peace and I too sat there again &amp; again ,atleast 8-9 times in 3 days to have that out of the world feel which some people have written online, but probably I was not that fortunate enough. In fact,as I have mentioned above, I could feel the strange energy Goosebumps (giving a feeling of extreme joy ) at Linga Bhairavi temple and even while chanting mantras at SuryaKund too but not at Dhyanalinga.Time to answer some questions as promised at the start of the blog :1. Is there really something Divine there ?Divine I don&#x2019;t know but yes , I felt the extreme rush of positive energy at some spots, especially at Linga Bhairavi Temple.2. Will you see something beyond physical there ?At least I did n&#x2019;t see or feel anything of that sort.3. Will you automatically start meditating there for hours ? Whole atmosphere of Isha Yoga Centre is such that Meditation is all that you think of while being there.4. What exactly is taught at Isha Yoga Centre ?There are a number of Yoga programs of varied duration going on there .Primarily ,introductory programs include Inner Engineering &amp; Hatha Yoga while Advanced programs include Shoonya Intensive,Bhava Spandana &amp; Samyama. Details about these programs are available here : http://www.ishayoga.org/en/advanced-programs .I didn&#x2019;t join any program as such but one can still participate in a number of activities even without joining any program .Among various things that I saw &amp; learnt over there , Aumkar meditation ( the correct way of uttering sounds &#x201C;Aa&#x201D; , &#x201C;Uu&#x201D; &amp; &#x201C;Mm&#x201D; in tandem , find audio here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG52gSt-fKI ) &amp; the knowledge about various scientific facts hidden in Mahabharta were really worth mentioning. Besides, I have now got addicted to Nirvana Shatkam mantra &amp; Brahmanand Swaroopa Isha sound ,mesmerizing they are,really.5.Is there any undesired commercialization ? No.This was one thing which few people have written online and infact it was also bothering me. But I am happy to write here that there is no culture of commercialization at Isha Yoga centre. No one asks you for donation anywhere , except for mere Rs.20 at SuryaKund which I think is legitimate going by maintenance required there.6.Is it fine to travel with family ? What about food ?There are absolutely no issues there.It&apos;s just that you go to such a place for a purpose,to spend maximum time meditating and hence kids can be little distraction otherwise stay is extremely safe and comfortable. You can book your stay at Nalanda or Nadhi cottages based on your requirement. As for the food, 2 meals are covered in your stay where you will be served simple &amp; healthy South Indian food. For the compulsive foodies like myself,there is Peppervine Eatery inside the premises which offer various delicious dishes / deserts / fresh fruit juices at a nominal price.On a Lighter Note3 days were very well spent at Isha Yoga Centre ,though it would have been probably an altogether different experience if I would have met Sadhguru.Nevertheless, many old questions got answered ,some new ones started juggling but just then , one phone call at the time of check out brought me back to the square one .It was my lovely wife Nishtha , &quot;Coimbatore Silk Sarees are World famous &quot; , she said. And I was supposed to understand the rest and act accordingly which I obviously did to make sure inner peace is maintained back home. :)I hope you too enjoyed this spiritual journey.Namaste &amp; Take Care !!You may read my other spiritual blogs here :https://insideoutwithrahulyuvi.com/category/blog/spiritual/Thank You !",

		"Text": "As we embarked for our first German travel, we were little disappointed that instead of visiting the all very popular Berlin , we were going to Heidelberg and a little known German City called Cologne. As the day progressed, we realized why exactly half knowledge is a dangerous thing and how badly we &#x2013; myself &amp; wife Nishtha, need to brush up our General Knowledge immediately. A few words about Cologne here will let you know why I am saying what I am saying .\nDay 1CologneHotelsMapCologne is a 2,000-year-old city which is the largest city in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth most populated city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). Located on both sides of the Rhine river, Cologne forms the region&#x2019;s cultural hub which boasts of having one of Europe&#x2019;s oldest and largest universities.But if I have to single out a particular monument housed at Cologne then it would definitely be the twin-spired Cologne Cathedral which is a landmark of High Gothic architecture, set amid reconstructed old town.Honestly speaking , beautiful is too small a word to describe the aura of this Cathedral . And what makes the whole environment around even more lively are these live musical performances :#Video : Live music at twin &#x2013; spired Cathedral ,Cologne , Germany (Pl. Play at 480 p)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5DHivY4JicThe whole set up around the Cathedral is very happening. (But why Church&#x2019;s walls are black ? Anyone ? Please leave your answer in the comments).It&#x2019;s kind of a city&#x2019;s central square with lots of hustle bustle . Among a lots of things worth a mention , following two stand out :1. India wale Burgers : &#x2013; It took us more than 96 hours of Europe Travel , covering 3 countries (France, Belgium &amp; Germany ) before we finally found a McDonald in Europe where the serving staff do knew that for God&#x2019;s sake , Burgers can be Vegetarian too .And my happiness knew no bounds when the lady on the other side of counter asked in Hindi , &#x201D; Beta , Burger ke sath Cold drink bhi chahiye kya ?&#x201D; (Would you like to have any soft drink with the burger, Son ?) I just could not control my tears of joy after hearing the word &#x2018;Beta&#x2019; (Son) and though originally I planned to add only soft drink but out of emotional exuberance I answered , &#x201D; Han Aunty , Coke , fries , Sundae and Mcpuff bhi de do sath mein .&#x201D; We Indians are very emotional people I tell you, just 5 more minutes in that McDonald and who knows, I would have transferred at-least half of my properties in that Hindi Speaking Aunty Ji&#x2019;s name ( while that I don&#x2019;t have any properties in my name, is a different thing altogether ). So Guys , if you want to enjoy some yummy vegetarian food in Cologne , don&#x2019;t miss this McDonald adjacent to the church .2. Lively Shopping Street : Why I have used the term Lively here is because people there were shopping along with singing &amp; dancing their way out in very literal terms . Yuvi too didn&#x2019;t miss the bus either :#Video : Dance &amp; Music on the shopping streets of Cologne ,Germany ! (Pl. Play at 480 p)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5u2EhrDmQIAs for the shopping , among various stores , we found Galeria Kaufhof a very good one , simply because it housed a whole lot of things including apparels , footwears , etc. under one roof ( kind of Supermarket featuring all good brands ) and prices were reasonable too .# Travel Tip : If you want to try a shoe or an apparel in any shopping outlet in Germany , (or for that matter, largely throughout Europe) then unlike India , please don&#x2019;t wait for some body from store staff to attend you in person. Simply help yourself , try apparels or shoes etc. on your own and get the billing done .That&#x2019;s it.No fuzz shopping.Further ,throughout the market area of Cologne , you will find this particular no. 4711 predominantly written outside many shops.On inquiring about this mysterious number, we got to know that the 4711 is actually a fragrance product (not a perfume, as the locals specifically point out ) which is extremely popular among the tourists . It&#x2019;s called the &#x2018;Water from Cologne&#x2019; .Because it has been produced in Cologne since 18th century , so it is allowed to use the geographical indication Original Eau de Cologne on the packing units. We too got ourselves a 4711 !! (4711 sounds like a James Bond secret wallet or something, isn&#x2019;t it ? )As we were about to leave for Heidelberg from Cologne , something happened which now seems interesting but at that time my heart almost sank . As Tour manager announced in one breathe, &#x201C;Only cash will be accepted for all the add on tours that you will opt from here on and today is the last day to confirm your bookings.So help yourselves but remember , we will leave in next 15 minutes sharp&#x201D; . Actually he did tell us a day before too but most of us pushed this task of getting cash to the last moment as we all were anyways carrying credit cards for other all practical purposes. However , as the situation demanded , I rushed through the streets to locate an ATM . After about a 5 minute walk , I found the one on a busy street. I immediately pounced on it , inserted the multi-currency card and boom !!All instructions were in German language . With my card stuck inside and less than 6-7 minutes left for my tour Bus to depart , I panicked. As a reflex action , I just looked up into the sky in despair and a glance back to ATM screen brought me back to life as it read English . I got myself the desired cash , collected my card and reached the bus when driver had just ignited the engine . A minute there &amp; a minute here would have forced me to take a taxi from Cologne to Heidelberg.#Travel Tip : While using any ATM in Europe , insert the card and wait for few seconds till the language you know appears on the screen. It will happen by default.HeidelbergHotelsMapHeidelberg is a town on the bank of Neckar River in southwestern Germany. Just like the Peeing Boy statue of Brussels, here too something in particular marks your presence in Heidelberg. And that&#x2019;s the presence of statues of the very famous bare backside baboon with mirror in his hand :The story behind the statues, as was told to us , is that the bare backside of baboon is inclined towards a town called Mainz situated on the other side of river bank , as a symbol of mockery /insult while the mirror in the hand of the baboon is to signify &amp; encourage critical self reflection among Heidelberg&#x2019;s locals . Whatever be the story , but the damn monkey needs to cover his back man !!When we reached Heidelberg , the dials already read 4 :30 pm local time , yet it was so hot there as the Sun unapologetically unleashed the scorching heat . So we just clicked a few photographs on &amp; around the old bridge before proceeding for Dinner &amp; the Hotel .Day 2Black ForestHotelsMapBut no travelogue on Germany is complete without the mention of a particular region which we visited the next day , while on the way to Switzerland . And that&#x2019;s , the oh so famous Black Forests , Schwarzwald &#x2013; the birth place and now the source of World&#x2019;s best Cuckoo Clocks . Wordbs just can&#x2019;t justify how magnificent the entire scene here was and I will just let these photographs do the talking.As the sun commenced to set in , we left for our last leg of Europe Vacations &#x2013; Switzerland, which should actually be addressed as The Switzerland, for it&#x2019;s heavenly natural aesthetics . It&#x2019;s truly a heaven on earth . More about it in my upcoming blogs.Stay tuned !Before we conclude , have a look at these really cute cars that we came across in Heidelberg.I hope you all enjoyed reading the blog . Please do share / Re-blog the post if you found it worth a read .Would really love to hear your feedback .Namaste &amp; Take care !!You can also reach me at: https://insideoutwithrahulyuvi.com/and athttps://www.facebook.com/Passport.Souls/or Just Google : Inside Out with Rahul Yuvi",

		"Text": "At first travel leaves you speechless and then turns you into a story teller! My travel buddy and best friend, Rajita and I backpacked 6 Countries covering 7 cities in a little less than 20 days. This post is about how we saved a LOT of Euros by not falling for touristy gimmicks the internet has to offer. This post is what we wished we had for reference when we started out planning and when we actually physically reached the respective cities. If you are willing to explore a city on foot/using local transportation and do not mind living in hostel bunkers, this post is for you!Pre-Travel Gear, Expenses and TipsLuggage : We DIDNOT carry rucksacks, instead got trolleys the size of hand luggage on flights. Yes, this seems less of space but this approach saved us a lot of money while booking intercity flights that allow rucksacks to ONLY be checked in. And for check in, these flights charge a bomb! And why carry when you can simply drag ;)Safety Gear : Paris and Rome in particular are known to be full of pick pocketers so we each had a travel belt (RFID belt) under our clothes every time we went to an extremely touristy spot. They are big enough to contain the passport and money and flat enough to not be seen. We were lucky no attempt of pick pocketing happened with us anywhere but better safe than sorry!Travel : FlixBus is hands down the cheapest and fastest mode of inter city or inter country travel in Europe. We saw a lot of advertisements for a month pass of the euro rail, but for our travel itinerary it didn&apos;t feel worth the money. FlixBuses are neat, have an attached bathroom, enough luggage space (they do not care how much luggage you carry) and leg space and have on board charging and WiFi facility. If booked in advance they can save you a lot of euros plus they are fully refundable before a certain date from booking.Accommodation : We did all our bookings from HostelWorld, it is the cheapest option available in comparison to everything else. We used this to find hostels that are as close as possible to the city center and have the best price for the number of people sharing the room. Reviews for every hostel, before booking, should be read because they give you a first hand experience of the hostel. For each hostel we paid between 1500-2500 rupees a night, which appears to be the standard cost. Most follow the same policy of a 3 PM check in and an 11AM checkout. But fret not, most agree to keep your luggage (at no extra cost) if you arrive early or leave late. Most are equipped with a kitchen so you can cook,eat and store in their fridge. Some come with complementary breakfast and some with a eat-all-you-can breakfast spread for around 7 Euros. Another great option to explore for accommodation is the concept of Couch Surfing; sounds a lot of fun but neither of us was interested in that. Make sure all your bookings are refundable, our visa issues were only sorted out a day before our travel, phew!Flight Cancellation : In case your flight out is cancelled and their customer service is not helping, go to the airport. The flight is responsible for giving you food, lounge access and stay (if the delay is more than 4 hours). It isn&apos;t mentioned anywhere on their terms and conditions (at least we couldn&apos;t find it) but it does apply. Also, you may use AirHelp to claim compensation if you face any delay. If eligible, they can help you claim up to 250 euros for the inconvenience caused.Student Discount : Most tourist attractions specially Museums have less than half priced tickets for students (from anywhere in the world)! So if you are studying in the year of your travel CARRY YOUR STUDENT ID CARD to avail all of this discount!Free Walking Tour : Almost every city has a free walking tour covering all the main tourist attractions. They&apos;re a great way to understand and explore a city&apos;s culture and historical relevance and meet people at the same time! Obviously sparing change/couple of bucks as tip is common courtesy :)Our Complete Itinerary \nParisHotelsMap4th July - London to Paris - Overnight Bus Journey - FlixBusStay : Absolute Paris Boutique Hostel (+complimentary breakfast)Transportation : To get around the city we DIDNOT get any of the easily available options like the Hop in Hop Off buses or tourist passes of any kind. We reached the nearest tube station and got a set of carnet tickets. These cost 10 Euros for 12 tickets. These 12 can be used for all journeys by as many different people. Paris underground is well connected and if you have GPS on your phone and are willing to explore the city on foot at your own pace, there isn&apos;t a cheaper option.Our Favorite Three-Free:Eiffel TowerHotelsMap  \t1. Our favorite was the Eiffel Tower light show. Its a 5 minute light show where the Eiffel twinkles across the Paris skyline. This happens every hour on the clock after sunset. You can grab a spot on the park opposite it, drink some wine or beer and immerse yourself in this grand concrete beauty.Sacre Coeur CathedralHotelsMap2. Sacre Coeur- is the most beautiful cathedral in all of Paris and you get a panoramic view of the whole of Paris from it.Luxembourg GardensHotelsMap3. We ditched the Louvre museum where we have the famed MonaLisa as it is apparently one of the most overrated things in Paris according to a lot of vlogs we saw. So we skipped entering the hot mess of tourists and simply enjoyed the summer sun and wind out side and loved it! We went to Jardin de Luxembourg instead; a beautiful garden where you can sail small boats with children in a pond or choose to lay down on the grass and soak the sun under the shade of trees.Food to Try : Crepes, Gelato, Flan, Apple Pie and lots of croissants!Missed Out On : We really wanted to see a cabaret show because of all that we&apos;d heard about it! Though more on the elite and expensive side the experience apparently leaves you spellbound.AmsterdamHotelsMap7th July - Paris to Amsterdam - Overnight Bus Journey - FlixBusStay : Meininger Amsterdam Amstel (all you can eat breakfast buffet for 7.5 Euros)Transportation : We purchased the 2 day GVK pass (covers all buses,trams, ferries) operated by them. Cost = 7.5 Euros per day.Our Favorite Three:De WallenHotelsMap1. A trip to Amsterdam without a visit to the Red Light District, De Wallen is for sure incomplete. Make sure to visit past sunset and kindly adhere to the rules followed in the area. It is closely guarded and any attempt of photo taking, staring or slurring can have serious consequences. You can have pee (Yes!) thrown at you or you can get seriously beaten up.Zaanse SchansHotelsMap2. We got away from the busy city hustle and did a day tour to the Amsterdam Country side. Tour and Tickets- Countryside and Windmills + Free Canal Cruise = 69 Euros per person.  \tThis was definitely worth the expense as we toured (guided tour) 3 different towns visiting windmills, cheese tasting (more that 25 varieties with dips) and clog shoe making (wooden shoes worn by farmers). It gives you a flavor of traditional European lifestyle and is not to be missed!Lovers Canal CruisesHotelsMap3. We redeemed our free Canal Cruise the next day and explored Amsterdam from water. It is a fully guided tour and we loved the occasional hilarious commentary from the Captain on board!Food : Pancakes, Stroopwafel and Heineken (the local brew)!Missed Out On : Although seemingly fun, we chose not to cycle around the city as it would be time consuming and would require constant navigation. Maybe on another visit :)PragueHotelsMap11th July - Amsterdam to Prague - Overnight Bus Journey - FlixBusStay : Czech Inn (our favorite hostel of all!)Transportation : 3 day travel pass for 310 CZKMoney Conversion : Prague is one of the few European countries where the Euro is not the official currency, which makes it extremely pocket friendly! Make sure to convert before hand because finding places that accept euros and travel cards may be difficult. Beware of zero commission currency exchange stores on the streets which may give you non-czech currency or offer a very bad exchange rate.Our Favorite Three-Free:VyšehradHotelsMap1. A more local place, the view point is beautiful as you see the whole of Prague and the surrounding water-body. Make sure to go during sunset. A great picnic spot as well, you can just lay listening to the church bells and enjoy the breeze.  \t  \t2. Free Walking Tour : It began at our hostel and took us to Old Town and the Jewish Quarters. We learnt about Czech history and the historical significance of structures. Our guide was young and peppy and made sure to give us fun facts and humor every step of the way. We learnt tips and tricks to get around the city and what we should do, eat and what we should not. For example in Prague, the beer capital of the world, a 14 euro Pub Crawl may seem like a tempting offer. But our guide warned us against it saying the alcohol quality and a 3 day hangover may not be worth it.  \t  \tJAZZ REPUBLIC Live Music Club PragueHotelsMap3. Walk down Charles Bridge after sunset into Old Town. It is hand downs the most beautiful view we ever saw. Its grandness and magnificence is not to be missed! We stumbled upon Jazz Republic, a place we loved so much we went there 2 nights in a row! A live jazz band plays everyday 930 PM on wards and there is no cover charge. In fact if you do not want to sit and order food/alcohol you are still welcome to visit. Plus, if you are a blues fan, BB King himself has played here!  \tSt.Charles BridgeHotelsMapFood : Fried Cheese, Trdelnik, Beer (everywhere)!Missed Out On : Prague was our favorite city and is extremely pocket friendly in comparison to other cities of Europe. We wished we had an extra couple of days here to bask in its simplicity and beauty!RomeHotelsMap15th July - Prague to Rome - Flight - Ryanair Stay : Meininger Romatermini (all you can eat breakfast buffet for 7.5 Euros)Transportation : After a lot of thought and research we found the 72 hour Roma Pass (38.5 Euros) best fitted our needs. It gave us free transportation access all over Rome and skip the line entry to two main attraction in Rome. We chose to go to the Colosseum and the Borghese Museum. This pass does not cover the Vatican Museum.Our Favorite Three: 3 days in Rome can be broken down into 3 different areas that can be covered individually only on foot. Please find below the order in which we did it :Day 1 - Galleria Borghese - Borghese Gardens - Spanish Steps - Piazza di Spagna - Trevi Fountain - Piazza NavonaVilla BorgheseHotelsMapDay 2 - The Colosseum - Roman Forum - Palantine HillRomes ColosseumHotelsMap  \tVatican CityHotelsMapDay 3 - The Vatican is the smallest country in the world. Though barely a travel from Rome, we did the following : Vatican Gardens - Vatican Museum - The Sistine Chapel - St Peter&apos;s BasilicaSt. Peter&#x27;s BasilicaHotelsMapTip and Tricks for Museum Visits : Do not fall for internet gimmicks and purchase your visit tickets before and from the official government website only! They do not advertise, so you have scroll down your explorer page to locate it. You can choose to go for a group tour or an audio guided one. An audio guided tour is always advisable so you learn on the go at your own pace and avoid getting mixed up in a large group of tourist. Each audio guide has ear phone plug ins that can be shared with TWO people! So get one instead of two! This trick saves you 5 euros or more for every museum tour! Also, use your student discounts as mentioned before, it&apos;ll cost you half the actual ticket cost.AnzioHotelsMapDay 4 - AnzioOur flight out to Barcelona was cancelled and we were put on a flight for the next day. This gave us one extra day to explore Rome so my travel mate convinced me to explore a near by beach and we did not regret it!A half hour train ride from Rome, Anzio, is very local and full of families, children and elderly alike. We had an amazing couple of hours sunbathing in the crystal clear water.Food : Pizza by the slice, Gelato, Pasta, Spaghetti Carbonara, Spaghetti BologneseMissed Out On : We wanted to do a day tour to Florence (3 hours from Rome by train) however, because of the heat we decided against it.BarcelonaHotelsMap19th July - Rome to Barcelona - Flight - Vueling Airlines Stay : Rodamon Hostel (all you can eat breakfast buffet for 4.5 Euros)Transportation : T10 Tickets (Zone 1)Our Favorite Three-Free:The Magic FountainHotelsMap1. The fountain show is for an hour and a half starting 9PM everyday. The extravagant light and dance of the fountains is perfectly coordinated with the latest song hits with the likes of Maroon 5, Coldplay, Lady Gaga etc. Thousands of people gather every day to witness this delight!Park GüellHotelsMap2. Park Guelle and La Sagrada Familia are creations by Gaudi and are a must visit in Barcelona. They are quirky, larger than life and look right out of a cartoon or comic. We didn&apos;t have time to enter any but did manage to explore the park and check out the Sagrada church from outside.Sagrada FamíliaHotelsMap3. We wanted to visit a less crowded and cleaner beach than the Barcelona city beach given we had only one evening. So we went to Badalona, a town 20 minutes from Barcelona with mostly locals. And it didn&apos;t let us down! Clean water and relatively empty we jumped in without a second thought!BadalonaHotelsMapWith this we wrapped up our Europe Travel. We did not sign up for a group tour and chose to plan the entire trip ourselves (quite a tedious task!). The internet and a couple of friends and family were Rajita and mine&apos;s only source of reference to plan out everything. And as solo girl travelers from India, we believe we did a pretty good job! And finally concluding our experience in Rajita&apos;s wise words:&quot;All it took was an year of savings, another year of daydreaming &amp; 3 months of serious hours long planning to pull this off! We experienced an incredible slice of history, nature, culture, architecture &amp; landscape in each.But most importantly, it was the immense sense of self-reliance that it instilled. Not only could we plan the itinerary to execution but could also pull it off by our own savings. For this sense of independence alone, I cannot wait to get back to work...&quot;. Trust us, if we can do it so can You :)",

		"Text": "Literal translation, the city of Lenin. The city where the fire of the Russian revolution was lit in 1917. The city where the concept of a worker&apos;s paradise was born. The city from which, the Tsars ruled for 300 years. The city where Rasputin whispered into the ears of the Tsarina and influenced the Tsar. The city that was once the capital of Russia. Where the Tsars were overthrown. Where the Bolshevik government rose to power. Where countless perished in Stalin&apos;s Great Purg e and more devastation was caused because of a siege by Hitler&apos;s Wehrmacht.Today, the city stands strong. A centre of Russian culture. Full of theatres and museums. Soviet-era architecture juxtaposes Tsarist era grandeur. Imperial opulence and communist frugalism. Russia as a nation is accepting it&apos;s Orthodox Christian roots after decades of godlessness. St Petersburg&apos;s is dotted with the onion domes characteristic to the Russian skyline. The city is no longer the seat of Russia&apos;s might.The power of St Petersburg started to wane when it was renamed to Leningrad. After forcing the Tsar to abdicate, the Bolsheviks moved the government to The Kremlin, in Moscow. The Kremlin is from where the current Tsar (if we can call him that) of the Russian Federation resides and executes his statesmanship.The winter palace along the Neva embankments in St Petersburg was abandoned. The large square in front of it became a place for demonstrations. Instead of the official residence of the Romanovs, it became a part of the Hermitage public museums. For the first time, the common people were allowed inside the private rooms of the Imperial family.The Hermitage Museum has endured the various regimes, and today is one of the world&apos;s most famous and largest museums, second only to the Louvre in Paris. To see the museum took us an entire day. To truly appreciate art it contains in its entirety may not be possible even in a week.The large square today holds various public concerts and events. As it was late December, we could see a Christmas event going on a drawing a large crowd. People dressed up as Santa Claus were mingling among the revellers enjoying the spirit of Christmas. This definitely wasn&apos;t something the godless Uncle Joe would approve of.Public Christmas celebrations are still a novelty in Russia. Under the communist regime, when the Russian Federation was still the United States of Soviet Russia, all religious celebrations were outlawed. Consequently, New Year&apos;s Eve celebration was the largest public celebration. The USSR followed a policy of &apos;State Atheism&apos;. Though they never outlawed formal religions, religious artifacts were confiscated, religion was ridiculed and atheism was preached in schools. A large portion of the Russian citizens is believers, as they were during the revolution of 1917. Most of them, however, are Orthodox Christians. The calendar they follow is a bit different than the Gregorian calendar followed by the world today. Accordingly, they celebrate Christmas on 7th January instead of 25th December. What is Christmas Day for the world, is treated as just another working day in Russia. Since the past few years, the state has been declaring 7th January as a public holiday.In December St Petersburg comes alive in the form of various street Christmas markets. There&apos;s a lot of food, books and gifts to buy. The long and wide Nevsky Prospekt is strung with decorative lights. This street is the heart of Russia&apos;s cultural capital. It is lined on both sides with hotels, restaurants, bars and stores. Here one can find a wide range of traditional matryoshka dolls along with other collectibles. People throng the pavements till late into the night. We landed in the city around midnight on a Friday night and as we reached our hotel on Nevsky Prospekt, I was surprised by the sheer number of people.There were so many people enjoying the nightlife offered by the city that was once called Leningrad. This vibrant street shoots away from the Neva at the monument to Alexander Nevsky to greet the river again to terminate at Palace Square near the State Hermitage Museum. Arguably the most famous icon of this city, the Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood, is located on an offshoot from this avenue. It&apos;s colourful onion domes clearly visible from Nevsky Avenue.This city has undergone name changes twice. It was founded by the Tsar, Peter the Great in 1703. After the First World War, because St Petersburg was deemed to be too German sounding, it was renamed to Petrograd, which still meant the city of Peter. The Bolsheviks, in their attempt to wipe out the centuries of Imperial history, started calling it Leningrad, in honour of their leader. And Leningrad it was, till the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.The metro railway system of St Petersburg is fabulous. Constructed in the Soviet era, its stations are grand and spacious, with high ceilings and chandeliers, and manages to keep up with the Soviet aspirations. A vast network covering all corners of the city, the travel fare is surprisingly cheap. One journey costs 35 rubles (1 ruble is approximately 1 rupee) and you can travel from any corner of the city to anywhere else. For short distances, though this might turn out to be expensive.The modern city St Petersburg is thus steeped in history. It has seen turmoil and stability. Violence and peace. Much of the city was destroyed in the Siege of Leningrad by Hitler. This siege is said to be one of the most destructive sieges faced by any major city in modern history. Acknowledging its survival, Stalin awarded it the title of &apos;Hero City&apos; at the end of the war. The people of St Petersburg, are very helpful. They will even go out of their way to help tourists. Language though is a huge problem. But a combination of broken English and gestures pulls you through. History lives on in this city. Moscow will offer you wide boulevards and government buildings, but St Petersburg offers a glimpse into Russian culture. If Moscow is the brain of Russia, St Petersburg is its heart!",

		"Text": "In much of Maharashtra, winter is a brutal period. One of the hot and dry days and chilly nights. Barren mountains and leafless trees. But come monsoon, and the scenario changes. The trees are densely covered with fresh foliage, the mountains are sporting a green blanket and the rain can bring a chill even at noon. The sun peeks intermittently through a break in the clouds. It&apos;s obvious that going up into the mountains at this time will be fun. No wonder, then, that monsoon is the season most popular for treks in Maharashtra. But that&apos;s too mainstream! Choosing to brave the heat and brown mountains which are less pleasing to the eye than their monsoon green version, is not.It is also something most would call idiocracy. But as we were in Nashik city, it was decided to go for a trek nearby. The Brahmagiri hills looked like a decent option for a short, day trek. The base of these hills lies not far from the Trimbakeshwar Temple near the city. For most of the climb, there are ancient stone steps. From the top, the river Godavari originates. This river is the second longest river in India and forms one of the largest river basins in the subcontinent. This river plays an active part in mythology too, as it is said that Lord Shiva diverted the Holy Ganga to Nashik which became the river Godavari. As an ode to this tale, the river is also called as Dakshin Ganga (Ganga of the South).The religious significance of this trek though wasn&apos;t as much of a motivation to us as the trek itself. We started climbing around 11am. As we hiked our way up the steps, the day was getting hotter. The sun soaring high above our heads. There was a steady stream of devotees both ahead and behind us. Turns out we weren&apos;t the only ones stupid enough to go hiking in the winter. But of course, most others had different motivations than us to climb.It took us almost an hour to traverse the time-worn, stone steps. At the top, we were greeted by a barren patch of land a downhill trail snaking away. The origin of the river was nowhere in sight. Looking at the ground, it was even hard to believe that a river flowed nearby, much less originated. We asked around and were advised to take the downhill path. The terrain was dry with loose soil. It was easy to slip down if not careful. At times we simply squatted down to avoid toppling over. The going wasn&apos;t completely downhill though. After a while, the land started sloping upwards again. Two or three such peaks later, we were finally able to see the temple housing the origin.Many people had come up here, braving the weather to pay their respects to the river. I don&apos;t know what I was expecting a river origin to look like, but a stone gomukh (head of a cow) with a small but steady trickle of water dripping down its mouth was definitely not. I had expected a river origin to be more natural perhaps. Maybe a spring jutting from the bowels of the mountain or the water from a vast lake cutting its way down the mountain. Years of worshipping the river had given a very human touch to it. The temple is a Shiva temple and the gomukh lies inside the temple. The actual temple itself is very small, managing to allow only 5-6 people to be inside at a time, so there was no shortage of friendly senior citizens outside willing to tell the story of how the river Ganga ended up in Nashik.With the source seen, we prepared to move back the way we came. Through the hilly terrain and down the steps. On the way back, a monkey climbed on one of us and started checking her pockets! She literally had to shake it off her. The sun had now started its downward journey through the sky. It was late afternoon and the heat showed no signs of relenting. Pushing ourselves and cutting through the stream of incoming devotees we finally made it down by 4pm. Just in time to attend a marriage in the evening, which was the real reason we were in Nashik!",

		"Text": "EuropeHotelsMapThe thing about Europe is that as a tourist destination, it&apos;s filled with places you must visit once in your lifetime, the romantic city of Paris, the Renaissance in Rome, the beaches of Barcelona and the pub crawl at Prague. There&apos;s absolutely nothing wrong with travelling to the much visited and hyped cities. But what sometimes gets missed in this touristy run- the pre-paid and pre-scheduled European Holiday package, are the off-beat and awesome places that fall under the radar. Half the fun of travel is discovery anyway, don&#x2019;t you think? If you like the non-touristy vibe and the pleasure of seeking something that others haven&#x2019;t, we bring you a list of some of the Underrated European destinations that must make it to your bucket-list this year. So book a flight to one of these 5 Destinations and experience culture, food, wine and nature like never before.Neuschwanstein CastleHotelsMap1. Neushwanstein Castle, Bavaria, GermanyNeuschwanstein is what fairytales are made of. Did you know? Walt Disney was inspired here and the Castle of Sleeping beauty is an inspiration from this castle.The million bucks view from the Queen Mary&#x27;s bride. Breathtaking ain&#x27;t it?The castle, in fact is incomplete and has a blotched history which in fact ends up adding to its mysticism. Resembling a medieval German Knight&#x2019;s castle, it was initially planned as a refuge for the &apos;mad&apos; King Ludwig II from the outside world. Well incomplete it may be, but even in its present state, the castle is one of the most visited attractions in Europe attracting more than 1.4 million visitors a year.Don&apos;t miss hiking up to Queen Mary&#x2019;s bridge and treating yourself to the most mesmerising view of your life. Due to the sheer magnitude, its location on top of a hill and its unique eye-popping architecture, the castle towers above everything else in the German Alpine countryside.Logistics : There are direct buses from Munich available to the castle. The only way to get inside the castle is to join one of the pre-booked organised 30 minutes tours. It is best to book in advance on their website as the tickets get sold out fairly quickly or arrive late in the afternoon as there are some reserved for direct sales.IcelandHotelsMap2. Golden Circle, IcelandIs this a landing on Mars? You&apos;d drive through sunlight, rain, hailstorms, snowfall maybe all in 1 day; pass by lava fields, volcanic rocks, gravel roads, sea, waterfalls, geysers and craters in this Golden Circle Road-Trip in Iceland. It takes time to come to terms with the fact that one is still on earth.The Golden circle around the National capital region(Reykjavik) is great for a 3-4 day visit.GeysirHotelsMapThe Keri&#xF0; crater (A volcanic crater filled with eye-popping blue water) and the Geysir Geothermal area (the original source for the English word &#x201C;Geyser&#x201D;) are wonders of nature that cannot be missed.Thingvellir National ParkHotelsMapAnother must visit is the &#xDE;ingvellir National Park, the only UNESCO listed heritage site in Iceland; also the only place in the world where you can see the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates drifting apart.Blue Lagoon IcelandHotelsMapPamper yourself at a mid-trip natural spa - the Blue Lagoon. The sight will leave you awestruck; steam oozing out of a very large hot water pool set right beside a volcanic landscape. Imagine experiencing two extreme temperatures at the same time; dressing in swimwear in sub-zero temperature and taking a dip in a pool of naturally heated water. Its cosmic, that&#x2019;s all we can say.ReykjavíkHotelsMapExperience the sophisticated night-life in Reykjavik, the capital town. Try Brav&#xF3;, a popular pub in the centre with probably the longest happy hours in town (1100 to 2100 everyday). Must try Cafe- Svarta Kaffid for traditional Icelandic soups (vegetarian available) served in an eatable bread bowl and with unlimited refills, quite interesting and hell yummy.It&apos;s a dreamy experience when travelling through this God-made wonder. You can only experience it to believe it.ChampagnéHotelsMap3. Champagne region, France ( A day trip from Paris)Epernay, the capital of the Champagne region in France, situated in the heart of the champagne growing region is the perfect place to explore the wineries and taste the finest creations of some of the best and the oldest champagne houses in France.The Avenue de Champagne in Epernay is one of the most prestigious avenues in the world and is an iconic UNESCO listed street. There are 110 kms of cellars and caves beneath this street that house more than 200 million bottles of champagne.Logistics: Best way to reach here is to take a train (it is just an hour and a half ride from Gare de l&#x2019;Est station, Paris) and explore the town on foot. Don&apos;t fall for the overpriced pre-packaged tours available in Paris.Moët et ChandonHotelsMap&#x201C;It takes years of effort for a few minutes of pleasure&#x201D;, our sommelier at Moet &amp; Chandon remarked while opening a bottle of Champagne during our degustation/wine tasting tour(Cost EUR 25 / person- totally worth it). This is a must visit when in the Champagne region, rightly so, as Moet and Chandon are the largest champagne producers in the world. A few other recommendations for wine tasting tours are the houses of Champagne de Castellane (cost EUR 14 / person, no pre-booking required) &amp; Champagne Charles Mignon.Enjoy the bubbly and don&apos;t forget to hike around the picturesque &#x201C;Vineyard Slopes&#x201D;.BrusselsHotelsMap4. Brussels, Belgium for the love of food and comicsForget history, forget architecture, forget politics and forget monuments; come to Brussels in Belgium to eat and drink. If you don&#x2019;t have a sweet tooth, develop one or you would be missing a real gastronomic roller coaster ride.Dvelve into the Belgian Waffle at Le Funambule conveniently located by the Manneken Pis. In the excitement of being in this foodie&#x2019;s paradise, we would have actually missed the Manneken Pis. What Effiel tower is to Paris, Manneken Pis is to Brussels. With only a &#x201C;little&#x201D; difference of size, that is.Walk to Mary Chocolatiers, the official chocolatier to the Belgian Royal Court for your craving of Belgian pralines and chocolates.Try the spectacular Speculoos, the unofficial National Cookie of Belgium at Maison Dandoy, who still follow the hundred years old family recipe for baking these delicious butter cookies.There are no French Fries in Belgium, only Belgian frites. Key differentiators- they are fried twice &amp; are fried in beef fat (All the veggies and non-beefeaters, Beware! food for thought). Have a bag of frites at Fritland or Friterie Tabora.There is no such thing as the best beer in the world. Hence, Belgium wouldn&#x2019;t give you the &#x201C;best&#x201D; beers in the world, what it would give you a wide variety and a thousand years old tradition of brewing this potion. Head to Delirium cafe, a Guinness records holder for the highest number of beers available; 3000+ beers from over 100 countries but it is the Belgian specialties you should be after. Try the Delirium red and Lambic (a beer brewing method unique to Belgium).Did you know? Brussels has the highest number of comic artists per capital in the world and it celebrates and proudly displays this through comic murals scattered throughout the city (Tintin fans, this is the place to be).What an amazingly creative environment to pursue art or discover your inner artist.PyrgosHotelsMap5. Pyrgos Village, Greece for the Caldera and WineMost people often miss Pyrgos village which is situated at the highest point of the Santorini island and is the only place that offers stunning views of both sides of Santorini; the caldera as well as the vineyards.Santo Wines WineryHotelsMapIt is also home to the world-famous Santo vineyards, which without doubt, is the most picturesque location for wine-tastings. The Santo vineyards in Pyrgos offer the most breathtaking caldera view with the best Vinsanto wines.Eat an early dinner at Selene in Pyrgos, a Michelin star restaurant or try the food at its little sibling (Selene Cafe) which is more casual and pocket-friendly. Be sure to hang around till sunset to see the magical view.Have a cocktail or two at Johnnies Cafe, a stunningly placed rooftop bar at the highest point in Pyrgos (the highest settlement in Santorini). It offers 360 degree views of the island that cannot be seen from anywhere else and houses an impressive selection of local cocktails (We recommend the Johhny&#x2019;s orange).Bikes are your best friend here (&#x20AC;20/day), hire and have a great island tour.About the Author :&quot;Megha and Pranay (alias The Trunk Travellers) are travelling around the world this year.

		"Text": "30-year-old Polish mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to successfully ski down K2, the second highest peak in the world. Located in the Karakoram mountains in Pakistan, K2 is one of the most difficult mountains in the world to climb. Bargiel and his team spent almost a month on the mountain to accomplish the feat. Bargiel ws accompanied by two of his brothers and a group of expert climbers from Nepal and Poland who planned out the expedition with him. It was not a new experience for Bargiel as he had attempted to ski down K2 last year but bad weather and high avalanche risk proved to be a big hurdle on his way. &quot;I&apos;m very happy it turned out well, because I&apos;m here for the second time, and I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t have to come back,&quot; Bargiel told CNN via satellite phone when he returned to the safety of base camp. July 22, 2018 is being regarded as a historic date and the feat is being heralded throughout the mountaineering world. Bargiel accomplished the tough task in just 8 hours.Bargiel&#x2019;s JourneyBargiel climbed at around 4 a.m. with his skis from a high camp on K2&apos;s flank to the mountain&apos;s summit. He reached the summit around 11:30 a.m. Once he arrived on the top, Bargiel started off his descent but was stopped at Camp IV - around 8,000 meters or 26,200 feet above sea level because of bad weather.At around 7:30 p.m, Bargiel made it to K2&apos;s base camp in just eight hours.&quot;I&apos;m very happy that I&apos;ve managed to ski down from the summit of K2 and get back to the base safely. I started to climb K2 at 4 a.m. on Sunday. The weather was good, but some problems appeared when I reached the peak and started to ski down. It was very cloudy and I had to wait for it to clear up at Base IV, because the next phase of my downhill was going to be very difficult and technical, on an extremely steep wall,&quot;&#xA0;Bargiel told Red Bull.One can imagine the difficulty level of the descent by the fact that the last two people who attempted ski descents of K2 could not survive. Deadly History Of K2&#xA0; K2 was first summited in 1954 by an Italian team and only 417 people have successfully climbed the peak since then. Though Everest is higher than K2 but the latter is technically more difficult to climb. For the same reason and because of treks made on way to Everest, about 5,000 people are estimated to have attempted to climb Everest since 1950s.The attempts made by people to ski down K2 almost always ended in tragedies. In 2010, Fredrik Ericsson fell to death while trying to ski down from the peak. In 1999, a 44-year-old Italian mountaineer, Michele Fait, died during an attempted ski descent.Bargiel&apos;s younger brother sent an aerial drone from mountain&apos;s base camp to film his epic solo summit. Equipped with an array of cameras, the drone also helped younger Bargiel keep an eye on his brother hence proving as a rescue device.Watch the stunning video of Bargiel&apos;s descent:    \nAndrzej Bargiel&apos;s descent is indeed an inspiration for people across the globe and for people from all walks of life. No matter how tough a goal looks, it&apos;s never unattainable.&#xA0;All images courtesy Red Bull.If you have a travel experience to share with the world, write here.&#xA0;For some amazing travel videos, head to Tripoto&apos;s YouTube channel.",

		"Text": "Chaubatia Gardens, RanikhetRanikhet is a lush green hill station in Uttarakhand. Literally, it means the Queen of Meadows, and we had been wanting to visit this tiny little hamlet for a long time. At last, on the Eid weekend, we finally set out for this journey, which was to be an unforgettable one.We boarded the Kathgodam Shatabdi from Delhi at 6AM, and planned to take a taxi from Kathgodam, expecting that the journey of around 75km would take at most 3.5-4 hours. Suddenly, we read in the paper that the day before, the taxi drivers in Uttarakhand had gone on strike, though the strike had been called off now. We were relieved, yet an uncertainty still lingered. Finally, when we reached Kathgodam, no one was ready to go to Ranikhet! Apparently, the strike was on and only pvt. vehicles were being allowed. Still, one brave and resourceful driver agreed to take us.But this was only the beginning of the drama which was to unfold. \nBhowaliHotelsMapThe route to Ranikhet passes along Nainital and Kainchi Dham. Every year on 15th June, there is a &apos;Bhandara&apos; held at Kainchi Dham, where more than 1 lakh followers of Neem Karoli Baba come to pay their tribute. Kainchi Dham is a great place to visit from Nainital(about 10-15 km), located at a very scenic and serene location. However, that was the worst time to visit if you are looking for peace and calm. The traffic jam was so bad that covering 1km took 30 min. Finally, when we reached Bhowali(our driver promised us that there was a pvt. car waiting to take us to Ranikhet), the police barricaded the route towards Ranikhet, not allowing any vehicles. They said that to reach Ranikhet, we had to go via Almora. It was already 3PM, and going via Almora meant going further 70 km in the hills. That&apos;s when the driver gave up, and took us to KMVN TRH Bhowali, which they adjusted against our KMVN Ranikhet booking.Day 1K.M.V.N. Tourist Rest House BhowaliHotelsMapThe staff at Bhowali guest house were really sweet, and the location is beautiful, circled by mountains but the facilities there are very limited. The menu is fixed, no non-veg, no western toilets in the rooms. Still, given the circumstances, it was a good bargain. It rained very heavily and in the morning, there was a slight mist circling the guest house. All the disappointment of the previous day was washed away!KMVN TRH BhowaliKMVN TRH BhowaliKMVN TRH BhowaliThankfully, the strike was called off, and we proceeded towards Ranikhet.Kainchi DhamHotelsMapOn the way, we saw Kainchi Dham from a distance. There was traffic jam in its vicinity, and it was drizzling, so we didn&apos;t get down.Day 2Kainchi DhamHotelsMapKainchi DhamKosi RiverHotelsMapThere is also a spot a little way ahead where a black rock shaped like a huge toad, presides under a suspension bridge.Finally we reached Ranikhet around 12.30 in the afternoon. We checked into KMVN TRH Ranikhet, where we had booked a Super Deluxe Room. It is supposed to be on the mall road, but it is a very secluded area lined with pine trees. I&apos;d recommend it to anyone who&apos;s looking for peace and quiet.KMVN Tourist Rest House RaniketHotelsMapThe property is very well maintained, with beautiful gardens and walking trails. Cycles are also available on rent. The staff is very helpful, and their menu is widespread. We didn&apos;t face any problems in our stay there.Chaubatia GardenHotelsMapAfter lunch, we set off to discover Ranikhet. Our first stop was Chaubatia Gardens. This is a Govt. orchard away from the main town. From the TRH, it was about 15km uphill, and a wonderful drive. The entire round takes 2-3 hours, so if you have the time, then please take the full round. We were short on time, so we took a trek of about 45 mins and came back. The views were amazing, and after a tiring trek the juices we had were bliss.Jhula Devi TempleHotelsMapWhile returning, we paid a visit to the Jhula Devi temple, which has a charming story associated with it. She is the local protector of the village, and nowhere have I seen so many bells in a single place!Kalika TempleHotelsMapOur next stop was Kalika Devi Temple on the other side of town. Here, there are joint temples of Durga and Kali ma. The location is very scenic, and the temple involves a short climb.MajkhaliHotelsMapThe road goes straight to Majkhali, where you can get an unmarred view of snow capped Himalayan peaks. It is further 10 km from Kalika Temple. However, we were short on time and didn&apos;t venture further.Golf Ground RanikhetHotelsMapOn the way back, we stopped at Golf Course Ranikhet. For a Golf Course, it is set in a picturesque location. However, there is not much to do here, unless you want to enjoy a family picnic.While returning to the hotel, our driver took us to the army museum. Unfortunately, it was closed for Eid, and we could not glimpse inside.Finally, we reached our hotel in the evening after a day of sightseeing in Ranikhet. The pakode we had as snacks, and the dinner were both sumptuous. Our driver was from Almora and also bought Bal mithai for us, which is famous in this region.The next day, we left for Delhi to board the Shatabdi. It took us around 5 hours to reach Kathgodam, due to traffic jam on a bridge near Kathgodam. Many people missed the train from Kathgodam, and the end of the journey was as adventurous as the beginning!My takeaways from this trip:1. Ranikhet is an amazing destination for some alone time, peace and calm. If you choose to visit this hamlet, do stay at the KMVN property at Mall Road.2. Never plan a trip to the hills in peak tourist season(May-Jun) as the traffic density is very high, and jams are very common.3. Always read about the place 1-2 days in advance to keep abreast of the latest situation and avoid getting caught in a strike like situation like us.4. Don&apos;t plan a trip to Nainital/Ranikhet around 15th June, due to excess rush in Kainchi Dham. Of course, if you are a believer, and want to pay your respects there, it&apos;s a different story.Day 3New DelhiHotelsMapThe hills are a wonderful retreat, but sometimes they throw surprises, so one must prepared for all eventualities and trust the advice of locals.",

Though there are enough joints selling Idli, Dosa and Uttapam, Chicken Chettinad is one of my favourite dishes from down south.

		"Text": "BanavasiHotelsMapLocated in the western ghats of Northern Karnataka lies a sleepy hill town, that has successfully managed to stay in a bygone time, as the world around it developed at a breakneck speed. Named Banavasi, this town is believed to be the first capital of Karnataka, ruled by the Kadamba Dynasty in 4th century AD. Deep in the rain forests of Western Ghats, on the banks of River Varadha, Banavasi has ancient temples and is blessed by cascading waterfalls and lush green fields during monsoons.Credits: Wikimedia CommonsWhy travel to Banavasi?This ancient town has been featured in writings of ancient travellers Greco-Roman writer Ptolemy in 2nd century A.D and Persian scholar Alberuni. And once you visit here, you&apos;ll know exactly why this small town has been enamouring travellers since centuries.Madhukeshwara TempleHotelsMapCredits: Wikimedia CommonsIt was in 4th century AD that Mayur Sharma, of the Kadamba Dynasty, established the first formidable centre on power in Karnataka, and chose Banavasi as his capital. He was the one who ordered the construction of Madhukeshwara Temple. Originally dedicated to Madhava (a form of Vishnu), the architecture of Madhukeshwara Temple is a mix of Kadamba, Chalukya, Hoysala, Sonda and Vijaynagara schools of architecture. The temple houses some exquisite sculptures and carvings namely the Trailokya Mantapa near the Nritya Mantap, an ornamented lithic cot, huge Nandi statue, honey coloured Shiva lingam and statues of the guardians of the eight directions.GudnapurHotelsMapIn the village of Gudnapur, 5km from Banavasi, lie the origins of the Kadamba dynasty. The archeological site has a pillar inscription of the Kadamba king Ravivarma. The inscription, in a box headed script, reveals the origin and genealogy of Kadambas and has a description of a temple, palace, harem and dancing halls. Today, all that remains of this ancient settlement are plinths of the aforementioned structures and a temple, with ornate statues of Jain Tirthankars, overlooking a vast lake that is flooded during the rainy season.Balligavi Kedareshwara TempleHotelsMapThe uneventful village of Balligavi, around 43km from Banvasi, is currently home to impressive temples of the Hoysalas and Chalukyas, that stand in stark contrast to the humble dwellings nearby. But, once upon a time, this tranquil village was home to around 54 temples and maths affiliated to Shaivas, Vaishnavas, Jains and Buddhists. However, the only thing left here now is some ruins and the two temples.Another temple in Balligavi, Tripurantakesvara, is a victim of the damage done by natural forces. The two parallel shrines facing east display signs of decay and whole portions of the temple have fallen into disrepair. However, there are still intricate carvings on the stone, you only need a keen eye to spot them. This is also a temple, that is from the Hoysala period but unlike other Hoysala temples, has a number of erotic figures carved all arounf the temple platform.Cuisine on offer&#x201C;Khanavalis&#x201D; or small eateries in Banavasi serve up hot, delicious food with a warm smile. There are several breads made of rice, jowar and corn as well as rice served with a variety of sweet, sour, pungent and spicy curries and sauces. Accompanying the meal is a wide range of fresh powders and chutneys made of lentils, chillies, and tamarind.When to goThe dry season from October to February is a great time to visit if you wish to enjoy the temples. However, if you also want to take in the lush greenery of the surrounding fields and paddy fields in full bloom, monsoon months from mid-June to August are perfect.Getting thereBy air: The nearest airport is Bangalore, 400km away. Daily flights from New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and other major towns of India operate to and from Bangalore.By train: Nearest railway stations are Shimoga and Haveri, 122km and 70km away respectively. Taxis and buses are both available from these towns to Banavasi. Taxis charge &#x20B9;10/km for a hatchback.By road: Bangalore to Sirsi (25km from Banavasi) is a popular route of KSRTC. Buses sometimes stop at Banavasi. Otherwise you can get down at Sirsi and take a taxi to town. Taxis charge &#x20B9;10/km for a hatchback.Getting aroundBanavasi is a small enough town that you can easily walk from one attraction to another. However, you can also take a day-taxi for all sights. Taxi prices start from &#x20B9;800 - &#x20B9;1000 for a hatchback. You can negotiate the prices.AccommodationThere is only one accommodation option in Banavassi itself.

By an extraordinary coincidence (fate ?!) in the headphones of my PDA sounded an old thing Murray Head &quot;One night in Bangkok&quot;The long-known song under the just experienced impressions of a trip to the river Kwai, superimposed on the beauty of the multimillion-dollar night metropolis, only heightened the feeling of some kind of unreality. I must say that this two-day excursion was one of the most unforgettable and, as the guides said, one of the most sought-after by Russian tourists, despite the rather high cost (plus minus 4000 Baht). The hotel on the Kwai River itself (by the way, it is pronounced like [kue:] instead of [kwai], as most tourists say, [quay] on the local means one of the swear words), swimming in its fast waters and under the waterfall, breakfast on the raft during the movement, elephant riding, rafting, bathing in thermal springs, cor-intergrowth of monkeys in the forest and many more must be experienced yourself. As they say, it&apos;s better to see once ...See another Thailand, its nature and customs, and not the dirty beaches of Pattaya, not everyone&apos;s famous Walking Street of this vicious city. Although this is also attracting crowds of tourists from all over the world, and it is also a part of modern Thailand.Bangkok. Catastrophically it was not enough one night and half of the next day to get acquainted with this original city. So I want to say the words of the famous movie heroine &quot;Bangkok - a city of contrasts!&quot; It dazzles with dazzling glittering gold temples, tall skyscrapers and, alas, poor neighborhoods of commoners.During the allotted time, I managed to visit the temple of the reclining Buddha (incredible beauty!), Swim through the canals and rivers of the city, and go to the jewelry factory.In the evening before I visited the BAYIOKE skyscraper, where you can admire the night Bangkok from a height of more than 300 meters and have dinner there in the restaurant (buffet). A little trick - after 20.00 the ticket gets cheaper almost twice and costs about 470 Baht.In Pattaya I was allowed to settle in the hotel &quot;Camelot&quot;, where the film &quot;Thai voyage of Stepanich&quot; was recently filmed. Zakazuha, of course, clean water; but nevertheless, in a comfortable sightseeing bus during the many-hour crossing, he allowed to brighten up the long road. Go tell: the hotel I liked. The new building generally looks pretty pathetic for its 3 stars. The old 7-storey is much simpler. But nevertheless, all that is needed in the room was a sin to complain. Besides, I&apos;m not spoiled by foreign service, because for the first time in my life I crossed the border of the homeland. Yes, and the situation at the hotel is advantageous: to the beach nearby, to Walking Street about 5 minutes, to the pier - 7 minutes. walk, all transport goes by transit (to Jomtien minutes 10 on tuk-tuk).The first day I was tormented by some strange feeling of deja vu. Especially when I, trying to cut off the road to the beach, wandered on some sort of narrow street. And then came the insight: for sure! It&apos;s fucking similar to Sochi! In general, it was decided to sunbathe, swim away from Pattaya Beach. For example, in Jomtien. But even better on the islands. The easiest option is the island of Koh Larn. Every day at 10 am (the optimal time IMHO) from the pier in his direction departs 1-2 ships. On the road 40 minutes, costs only 20 Baht per person. It is possible and more speedboat, but already more expensive. There are several beaches on the island; most liked Samae Beach (if nothing with the letters did not mess up).There, only merchants of all kinds (for example, belts from a crocodile or ostensibly precious pebbles) can bother their dogging. The rest has a comfortable rest. With the pebbles in the middle of the island, the beach generally looks like a paradise. Advertising &quot;Bounty&quot; probably shot on one of the Thai islands. :-)In Pattaya, we liked mini Siam. It is such a park, where world-famous architectural buildings in miniature are collected.In the middle of my trip i visit some of the courses of SEO lessons about istagram, here i listen about instagram views, how to buy them and how they are how they affect your account. This is a good experience for me.BangkokIn the evening all this economy is colorfully highlighted and looks just great. In addition, you can make up your knowledge of history and geography by reading a short annotation for each exhibit.Thai temples, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed and many other things will quickly eat up on the flash drive of your digital friend. With a film camera, I&apos;m afraid that only pros go there.However, mini-Siam works only up to 22 hours, so hurry up. It is somewhere on Sukhumvit, got to him by taxi (from Second Road ride 10 minutes).One of the strongest impressions of my Thai voyage is Nong NoochTropical garden nong nuch - excursion in pattayaThis place is about 20-30 kilometers from Pattaya. But I do not advise you to go there with an excursion, but on your own. Otherwise there will be an option &quot;gallop across Europe&quot;. We spent almost all day for a walk in the park, and then not all went around. Excursions also carry",

		"Text": "It was only my second weekend in Bangalore but I was busy checking the weather of all the weekend getaways I could go to. Mysore really wasn&apos;t at the top of my list, but the only place with decent weather left me with no other choice. So I went to Tripoto, searched some blogs, and frantically booked a bed at The Mansion 1907 hostel in Mysore, barely 24 hours before the trip. And that was all the planning I did. \nDay 1MysoreHotelsMapSo Saturday morning at 6:30, I left my place, and took 3 buses to reach The Mansion 1907, Mysore around 11:30 am. The hostel is actually a very old, beautiful mansion turned into a hostel-cum-yoga place by the owner. I straightaway freshened up and rented a bicycle from the hostel itself at Rs 100 for the day. First, I went to The Old House cafe, where I had my lunch. The place serves some brilliant Italian cuisine, and the ambience only adds to the experience. From there, I headed to the Mysore Zoo, which turned out to be way better than expected. The entry fee of Rs 80 plus Rs 100 for the camera seemed a bit much, but totally worth it. Sri Chamarajendra Zoological GardensHotelsMapThe zoo was very well-maintained, had all common, endangered and exotic animals and birds. The zoo is spread out through a vast area of 157 acres and it took me about 4 hours to cover all of it. Then I headed to the Mysore Palace, but it had closed down by that time (5:30 pm is the closing time). So decided to go to the Wax Museum since there was still some time before dark. The entrance fee costs Rs 40, and it&apos;s a very small museum. The museum is very average, and unless you&apos;re a big fan of wax art, you can very well give this a miss.After the wax museum, I headed to Hotel Vinayaka Mylari for Mysore Dosa. Two food blogs had recommended masala dosa from this place. And the place did not disappoint. I was served my dosa within 30 seconds of me sitting at the table. I was still searching for the menu, when they brought my meal. I then got to know that dosa is all they had. Within 10 seconds of me starting my meal, the waiter asked whether I wanted another one! Quickest service I&apos;ve ever seen, by far. Yes, I definitely took another one. The dosa is so soft, buttery and melts so smoothly in your mouth, you can&apos;t have just one.I topped my dinner with Mysore&apos;s best filter coffee ( as per another food blog) from Hotel Siddarth. I can&apos;t say whether it&apos;s the best that Mysore had to offer, but the hotel restaurant is definitely worth going to, just for that coffee. I had it again the next morning.After the coffee, I went to my hostel and watched the FIFA World Cup 2018 third place match. What was supposed to be a 90 minute chill session turned into intense 4 hour conversation over wine with my amazing hostelmates. That&apos;s the best part about hostels. It brings people so close, and gets them so comfortable, within just hours of them seeing each other.Day 2Mysore PalaceHotelsMapThe next morning I headed to the Mysore Palace. And I absolutely loved the place. The grandeur of the whole monument takes some time to sink in, and one could easily spend over 2 hours here. Then I went to the Rail Museum and Jagmohan Art Gallery. Both of these can be missed if you&apos;re not a big art fan, but if you do have time, a visit to atleast the Rail Museum is recommended. Chamundi HillHotelsMapAfter the museum visits, I took a bus to Chamundi Hills, near Mysore. The bus ride is about 20 minutes long but goes through winding curves along the hill. There&apos;s also a 1000-step stairway that goes to the top. You&apos;ll get better viewpoints from this route. Do ask around for this route. There&apos;s a temple at the top, which was very crowded that day. I didn&apos;t feel like going in. For me, the view from the top was more important and that made the whole trip worthwhile. I also, very surprisingly, met a college friend at the top, with whom I came back to Bangalore. It only added to the fun. Check the pictures below. Cost Breakup:Transportation: To-and-fro bus from Bangalore ( Satellite bus stand ) Rs 250 + Rs 300 for internal transportation.Accommodation: Rs 500 for hostel bed.Food: 2 days&apos; meal around Rs 750Museum Tickets and Miscellaneous expenses: Rs 400",

The famous river Umngot flows through Dawki and is the border river between two countries. Journey to Dawki was rich with nature! Without doubt I would say, Meghalaya is rich with waterfalls and I was able to view waterfalls throughout the state and became too much addicted to this sight. On the way , I could clearly view the land of Bangladesh on one side . Driver told us that the huge buildings we saw on the right side of the road are part of Dhaka. As we reached Dawki, I found that Umngot river was super clear as I&apos;ve seen in pictures and trust me that wonderful sight would always add peace to your mind . The location I have seen many times in snaps and google images is finally right in front of my eyes and I was extremely happy. But guides told us that the river may look more crystal clear during Oct- Nov seasons. Since our travel was in July, according to them umngot was not clear. But it didn&#x2019;t matter to us as it was beyond our expectations!!Umngot river It was a natural wonder!! The green vegetation at the sides of the river made the water look greenish!!Fishing boats painted in yellow, green and blue colors were seen here and there and that added extra beauty to the green river . The boatmen charged us Rs.500/- per boat and four of us got into it and started the journey. We could view the suspension bridge for the traffic to cross Umngot, and it was said to be built by the British . Britishers might have used this route for trade and material movements across the borders. Even today, goods are transported to and from Bangladesh through this route.As we progressed the boat journey, I could see the borders of our motherland and we were nearing towards Bangladesh .After few minutes the boatman dropped us at the white sandy banks and we stepped out to take few snaps. To any photography addict, I would say this is a must visit location and believe me your camera&apos;s won&apos;t get rest!! After spending some time there , we again got back to boat and started return journey waving bye to Bangladesh natives along the borders.We sailed for about 25 minutes and reached the banks, but to be frank I didn&#x2019;t want to get out of boat. Hoped that journey never ended! It&apos;s green, green everywhere and the beauty of pristine waters cannot be expressed in just words, it should be experienced! Activities like scuba diving, cliff jumping, fishing, rafting, zip lining can also be experienced depending on the climate and season.Video below was taken during my visit. Have a look !!\t  \tVideo taken during Dawki VisitHow to reach Dawki -Nearest railway station is Guwahati Nearest airport is Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport.After reaching Shillong you can hire a cab / taxi to reach the destination.Bu bus - Take bus from Shillong to Dawki . From Dawki, it is a 1.5 km walk to Tamabil.",

		"Text": "Day 1ToshHotelsMapHow to reach Tosh?Get a bus from Kasol until Barsaini, Then either trek until the village (Which is quite time-consuming but beautiful experience) or Get into the car which keeps on coming to and fro Tosh.What will be the budget?Kasol to Barsaini - 75INR / Barsaini to Tosh - 100 INR.Per night stay - varies from 500 to 700 INR.Food - 300 INR - 600 INR per person a day.Where to stay?Snow View Hotel and Restaurant: 88942-06092Pink Floyd - 78075-11908Hotel Blue Diamond, Tosh - 086288 55069, 098051 55069So I took Bus (which comes once in an hour) from Kasol for Barshaini - It is the last stoppage. Manikaran comes in between these two places, which has hot springs and plenty of gurudwaras (Due to lack of time, I skipped)So, after reaching Barshaini, you trek to either of three villages - Phulga, Kheerganga, Tosh or take a cab which is always moving there. They charge you 100 INR.My driver told me about Blue Diamond hotel and Pink Floyd Cafe and hotel for the stay. On reaching Tosh, I had completely lost my Cellular signal, so no chance of hunting online places. Tosh is completely commercialised village. You will find cafes and hotels everywhere. But to get a hotel of your choice you will have to keep on trekking.On the top of the Mountain, I finally saw Pink Floyd cafe, but there was no vacancy for a room. Also, I tried finding a vacancy in Blue Diamond hotel - Which unfortunately was not available either.After a lot of hardship, I found the best ever hotel I could find in the whole Tosh. It was a little away from the hustle of the village, named Snow view hotel.The valley in front of the valley had no building, it was totally surrounded by greenery and it had a waterfall nearby as well. I got serenity at its best. Even the cafe owner was so humble. Their food was good too. Plus this hotel is so isolated that hardly there is any crowd. I enjoyed my food and my view. And spend the rest of the night listening to music and socialising with a group from Chandigarh. We all chilled.Before going to the bed, I had the most phenomenal view of my entire life, I literally saw Paramount logo coming alive in front of my eyes - with the same Everest and stars forming a semi-circle around it, And my sunshine constellation was inside that semi-circle. I could hardly take my eyes off the whole scenario. It felt like the life had some plans for me already and it is inviting me to step into my adulthood with its open arms. That logo floats at the beginning of every Hollywood movie produced by Paramount. It felt similar to my psyche.I also experienced some really crazy funny imaginations like - I saw the two different mountains as a part of some sci-fi movie. One of the on my right felt like a huge octopus while another felt like the giant spaceship (Due to the illuminating while dreamy lights coming from the moon at the back of the mountain)which has recently landed on the planet earth. It seemed they are about to have a fight. And the mountain in the middle, which was completely covered in snow white - looked like the battleground.Ah, as soon as my trippy imagination ended, I found myself singing in the bed with my window directly opening to the whole view. There were no big balcony in the front, If you looked down the window it was all deep valley and if you look up in the sky it was only galaxies and moon and shining snow off the top of the mountain and some UFO lights coming from the mountains.I dozed off for sure, as I woke up the next morning all fresh and energetic. I shot some clips for my Youtube video and Bounced off to Bhuntar to catch my bus to Delhi for going back to Jaipur on 4th afternoon.",

		"Text": "A little bit of introduction: Ladakh was calling me a long time ago and I was not willing to settle for something less of a destination. When I found my Herculean task was successful enough ( save a part of my salary for the trip), I set off for the journey, alone. With limited time in hand, I completed the entire trip in less than a week, though many refused to believe so!NB: Photos are taken in my Asus ZenFone Max as I could either buy a DSLR or go a trip to Ladakh with the money I had!????Day 1LehHotelsMapThe flight from Kochi landed New Delhi past midnight and I killed time till my next flight flew, to the land of high passes. This plan saved a day for me, and some Indian rupees too.Flying to the land of high passes:Air India and a few other private companies operate flight services from New Delhi to Leh, and though you book them early enough you will not get any fare less than Rs 4000. But flying to Leh is worth every penny you spend, for it saves you 3 days, and more than that, you will fly over the mighty snow crowned Himalayas....and no wonder you will be awestruck.Day 1 is spent on acclimatization, which is a must for you to adjust to the high altitudes.A view of Himalayas while you fly to LehDay 2Zanskar RiverHotelsMapThis day is used to visit the nearby places of interest as going higher altitudes is restricted on day 2 also. You can, with no doubt, spend Rs1400 for a river rafting in Zanskar river if you are for adventure. The 14 km rafting ends at the confluence of Indus and Zanskar river. After that you can visit Pathar Saheb Gurudwara where you will be served a simple meals (langar) also. Later pay a visit to the Hall of Fame, a Kargil war memorial. In the evening roam in the Leh market and purchase the prayer flags and handicrafts. Also don&apos;t forget to sip a cup of Kashmiri Quawa tea.The confluence of Indus and Zanskar riversA view of Leh market @8pm ISTDay 3Khardung LaHotelsMapThis day will start early as you have to travel six hours at a stretch to reach the Nubra valley. And on this way you cover the highest motorable road on earth, the Khardungla pass. Bad roads decorated with snow on both sides welcome you to the pass. Later the road descends to the valley with streams and grasslands gifting you one of the beautiful roadtrips ever. Then the topography changes into a dusty cold desert which may seem hostile to you. On this journey it&apos;s better you take some nuts and fruits with you as the food in the norms of lunch will be difficult to find on the way. After reaching Nubra check in to the hotel( hotels here cost around 3000 per day on a twin sharing basis). You can visit Turtuk monastery and also the cold desert where you can ride a camel.A view from Khardung LaSteering through the highest motorable road on earth!Day 4Nubra ValleyHotelsMapThis day you return to Leh through the same old route. (There is another route directly to Pangong tso via Shyok valley which is not at all advisable and bikers taking that route better ensure they ride on their own well conditioned bikes). On the way you see spots where you can enjoy an ATV ride on the sands. Afternoon you reach Leh and you can rest or even pay another visit to the market and try local cuisines out there.On the way to Nubra valleyThe cold desert at Nubra valleyDay 5Pangong TsoHotelsMapThis day we cover the famous Pangong tso, the picture perfect lake that became famous after the &apos;three idiots&apos; movie. Usually people cover it in two days, but if you start as early as 6 in the morning, you can easily cover Pangong tso in a full day round trip, and believe me, it gives enough time to enjoy the lake. Again except a few remote outlets, it&apos;s difficult to find food on the way.The picturesque Pangong tso !Day 6It&apos;s time to bid goodbye to the land of fluttering prayer flags and lovely Ladakhi people. Catching a flight in the morning will reach you in NewDelhi before 12 noon. And I flew to my home in Kerala, thus completing this phenomenal Leh trip in less than a week.Some points to note: The season in Leh is from mid May to mid September. Its advisable to carry jackets, SPF 30+sunscreen and a good pair of sunglasses. Also carry Anti AMS (Altitude Medical Sickness) diamox tablets, which otherwise you can get from Leh also. Taxis are available from Leh at fares fixed by Ladakh Taxi union. Bike rentals are also available in plenty at Leh which are charged at around Rs2000 per day without fuel. Hotels are available at reasonable prices at Leh but costs you dearer in Nubra valley.Only postpaid airtel and BSNL sim cards work in Leh and BSNL is preferred as it has signal even in Nubra and Pangong and almost across the entire area that covered. Hotel wifi is available but it can&apos;t be relied upon at any cost, so taking a postpaid BSNL connection is advisable to get connected with friends and family.For information related to Inner Line Permit, visit https://www.lehladakhindia.com/innerline-permits/.Thanks for reading.

		"Text": "Pangong LakeHotelsMapDriving through the snow-capped Himalayan mountains, witnessing mesmerizing lakes, experiencing peace in monasteries and having tea breaks after long drives in the middle of nowhere- now that’s a perfect trip to Ladakh.I visited Ladakh with my family in 2017, primarily because we&#x2019;re all a big fan of rocky mountains and freezing temperatures. We visited in the month of September, which was the perfect time of the year for this travel destination.This mountainous region in the State of Jammu and Kashmir has a lot of alluring points like the Leh palace, the Magnetic Hill or the Nubra Valley. However, the spot in this &#x2018;land of high passes&#x2019; that stole my heart was the enchanting Pangong Lake.As we drove through the rugged mountains, from Leh to the valley that held the lake, we saw a bright blue triangle in the middle of the brown arid landscape. It was a long five hour drive to this stunning location. While the drive (and the lack of oxygen!) had drained all our energy, as soon as we reached the area, all our exhaustion turned into excitement. We put on our winter clothes, layers and layers of warmth packed under our coats, and got ready to experience this chilling site.Being a Bollywood buff, I have watched a fair share of scenes in Hindi movies that feature the Pangong lake- from the climax scene in 3 Idiots to the &#x2018;Banjarey&#x2019; song in Fugly. Being exposed to these media pieces, I was somewhat prepared to witness a pretty spot.But as I moved closer to the point, I realized that those movies don&#x2019;t do justice to this mesmerizing location at all!The striking blue water paired with the bright sky, the endless rocky mountains, the barren landscape, the colourful Buddhist prayer flags- all add a charm to this splendid area that the camera just can&#x2019;t capture.We spent about an hour adoring the region, numbing from the cold temperatures but still managing to click Insta-worthy pictures. Later, after sipping some warm coffee and gulping down hot momos at the Rancho Cafe, we left the main location, looking for a place to spend the night.We had two accommodation options- staying at a hotel or camping near the 125km long Pangong Lake. Being the wild souls that we are, we obviously chose the latter!By the time we reached our camping location and settled in, it was already dusk. The water was very close to our camp, less that half a kilometer. So, we defeated our fatigue, put an end to our laziness and went for a quick stroll alongside the lake. We chatted along the way, enjoyed the view and had another quick session of photographs.On our way back, we could smell delicious food being cooked at our camp kitchen. Later in the evening, we relished an elaborate dinner, followed by hot gulab-jamuns.Since it was too windy a night for bonfire, we stayed for a while in the dinner room itself, bonding with our travel buddies. After a fun night of laughter and games, we all went back to our tents, tucked ourselves into the blankets, and had a good night&#x2019;s sleep.The cold woke us all up a little earlier than usual, so we witnessed the sun rise through the rocky mountains. The reflection of the golden sun on the Pangong Lake increased the beauty of the region further. After having a heavy breakfast and biding farewell to everyone on our camp site, we started our journey back, cherishing the moments we spent at the picture-perfect site. &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;",

Landmark- BDA Complex, Indra Nagar Metro station2. How to reach ?The easiest way is to get a Metro to Indranagar and have a little bit of walk. otherwise there is always a Uber and Ola.3. Cuisine Type ?Yogi-sthaan cafe is a macrobiotic vegan friendly, entire food is cooked and served with Ayurvedic principles proving a yogi life style.4. Pet Friendly ?Yes ! Indeed very much.Synopsis- So we got into rickshaw to reach this place around 5 Pm in evening and was surprised to see that this place actually was located in a quiet place. we entered into the place and there was a shoe stand which said &quot; Please leave your foot wear here &quot; Yes, you cannot enter this place with the footwear. once we entered we got a table for ourselves, they have a different kind of seating&apos;s. There was a hammock, White painted tables and chair, and also on the other end with a small cots with pillows.The best thing about this place is you can really hear very minimal honking or traffic sounds considering it is located at residential area. My friend and I were almost saying to ourselves that this does not seem like Cafe in Bangalore. It more so felt like we were in some shack at Beach side.There dishes are very organic .We ordered Filter coffee and they served with Jaggery instead of sugar, We also ordered saffron tea that was filled with honey and almonds.The menu said that Jaggery and Ghee toast is &quot;MUST TRY&quot; and yes we did try and it tasted very yumm and authentic.Need to say, they even have happy hour that serve some amazing dishes. They also have a board that says that if you ring the bell 9 times then you get a free TEA. this was something cool (Watch this at my video )We took a tour to see the place and they have a small library with plenty of books, It is indeed a good place if you are passionate about reading.Nevertheless, if you are into well being then this is the best choice because they even have yoga classes from Monday to Friday.They have two sessions - One during the day from 7AM to 8 Am and evening from 7PM to 8PM.They even have a Stay facility. Yes if you are visiting Bangalore and want to stay at a quiet place then you should probably consider Yogisthaan.Although they have some rules like - Vegetarian food only, No Drinking, No Smoking and No friends in late night . Which can actually be compromised if you are living at place as peaceful as this. Guests can access Living room, Yoga and Music classes which is also quiet nice.They have a small boutique that sell some cool yoga T-shirts, Detoxing vessels, Organic Groceries &amp; Gourmet.They recently have come up with a food delivery option if you are living somewhere close to 1km . Lucky people who stay closely I must say :)On the whole this place is great if you love some peace and some Quietness.Regards,Swetha Kumar",

		"Text": "During the last year of my graduation, I left my college hostel and shifted to a flat in the Jaipur city. I was a student of Amity University Rajasthan, which is located at a distance of 36KMs from the main Jaipur city - On Jaipur Delhi Highway (NH11). So it was quite a pain to travel to the city for every other occasion. I was a student of Journalism and mass communication and I wanted to take some good exposure in the market by doing some part-time job while managing classes. Hence, I took the decision to shift outside and free myself from any possible unnecessary foundation.My landlord and lady were quite friendly until I got acquainted by the drinking habits of my landlord. He had no children of his own, so he used to look up at us to fulfil that void in his life - which is evidently not possible all the time- because I had a lot of other things to do like - going to classes, managing job and also completing my assignments at night.He had decent families as their tenants at their bungalow. One on the ground floor, we stayed adjacent to their place - our (mine and landlord&apos;s) doors were just an inch apart (hence they&apos;d seep in anytime-creepy). and two other families upstairs.Every night he used to drink (not that he&apos;d get drunk) and he would send his wife to ask if we have had our (my roommate and me) dinners and used to get us some home cooked food, instead of talking hours and hours with us, which would stretch up to 2am. We were quite fine until it became his daily habit. We decided to leave the place but couldn&apos;t, as either other places were quite expensive or already occupied. Meanwhile, his tenants on the ground floor left due to some internal issues with him.It was the time I went to Pushkar with my friends for the Camel festival when he himself shifted all my stuff downstairs. Then a few days later, he started getting it renovated by breaking all the walls and pillars (While all my stuff were already there). He shifted all the kitchen items to my bedroom, leaving it all smelly and hard to breathe - whilst it was a dark room with no ventilation.\nDay 1JaipurHotelsMapImagine staying at this place - I couldn&apos;t.I couldn&apos;t spend my New Year Eve there at any cost - all low, devastated and alone. (As all my friends went to their hometowns, few went for their course internships - I couldn&apos;t go home because my family stayed in Bangalore and going there just for few days was an expensive affair). So I called up my friend in Delhi and asked if I can come over, He said that he will be celebrating his new year in Agra. I said, Ok I am coming to Agra as I cannot push myself to feel more depressed.Anyway, That is when I left for Agra from a direct train from Jaipur. It was a two-day trip. I spent my New Year midnight in the general train compartment. It got delayed by 5-6 hours. I reached Agra at 3am, while it was meant to reach by 9:30pm.TRAIN FARE: 200 INR (GN) two-wayI got many calls from my friend asking me when am I going to reach and that they were staying at a budget hostel with people from Spain and France. So I missed my New year celebration miserably. And when I called him by the time I reached - he didn&apos;t pick up. I was shit scared at Agra station as I didn&apos;t know where to go.I called my ex-roommate from college hostel, she is from Agra and lived nearby in the Railway colony. She is the one who saved me that night. I went to her place, we made Maggie as I hadn&apos;t had anything all night and I was quite hungry.That&apos;s her placeNext day, I greeted everyone in her family and thanked her mother especially. Then I left for the hostel where my friends were waiting.MY STAY: Sleep Inn HostelCOST: 349 INRWe all were rejoiced after seeing each other, then punched each other for not being responsible enough and not picking up call at 3am. (I know adulting is quite hard sometimes) *Wink*E-RICKSHAW FARE: 40 INRWe headed towards Taj Mahal - One of the seven wonders in the world, where I had been earlier once during Diwali - The festival of lights in India. But for my friend, it was his long-awaited first time.Day 2AgraHotelsMapTAJ MAHAL, AGRA - INDIAOn New Year Eve, The whole Taj Mahal Area was overcrowded with people, there were !km long stretch of people scattered here and there. People were bribing some locals to get in there, the security was uptight as well.BUT, we came out with some really dope pictures! So I don&apos;t feel sad about the bad moments I went through, by the time when nobody stood by my side (Except few tried) But I don&apos;t blame anyone.I even clicked few random people&#x27;s picturesThese were my New Year SaviorWhen I got back, I stayed at one of my classmate&apos;s place for a few days until I found a really beautiful apartment for myself.

		"Text": "I have been meaning to share a whole lot with you all. But work keeps me on my toes these days and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. Huh! I may be in love with my job - that can&apos;t be bad, right?In addition to work, we did end up traveling quite a bit last year: we did a 10 day trip to Eastern Europe, a short weekend (plus plus) getaway to Malaysia. And also a birthday trip to Hampi, north of Bangalore in India. Therefore, there is a ton to write about.Since, I am getting back to writing after so long, I want to start with something that I can&apos;t stop raving about - which is the FOOD in Malaysia - its yummy, its full of variety and its cheap (and we love cheap - don&apos;t we?).Seriously, while packing for a trip to Malaysia, pack an extra tummy!Where to go: Now, there are multiple street food markets in Kuala Lumpur, but the following are the most popular, and for good reason:What to eat: Now that you know where to go to find your favorite south east asian food, here is a list of my favorites (also a couple of not so favorites) from Malaysia: Tom Yam Fried Rice: I love the Tom Yam soup and chances are that you do too! Well, take that and add to it some crunch, some rice, and extra spices! Tan tanaaa- that&apos;s Tom Yam Fried Rice for you. We had this on a beach side restaurant in Penang and ever since that, I have been craving for it. Tom Yam Soup: What&apos;s better than Tom Yam Fried Rice - yep! a mightly bowl of Tom Yam Soup. We ordered this in the Jalan Alor market - and it was enough for the both of us. Ofcourse, there is curry noodles, nasi goreng, sea food fried rice and other yummies to try in this market. Deep Fried Ice Cream: I am no stranger to deep fried ice cream. Every year at the Calgary food festival, I used to devour this innovative piece of lump like a crazy wolf. But, in Malaysia, its a 100 times better. I unfortunately, do not have a photo of it, but feel free to look it up on the net. Don&apos;t mattah if you do that or nat - you gotta eat this shit when in Kuala Lumpur! Mochi Ice cream: Mochi ice cream is pretty popular in South East Asia, Japan and Korea. It&apos;s basically rice and ice cream and comes in a variety of flavours. But to each his own, I did not like it too much. Something which is not supposed to be in the ice-cream kept bothering me - not sure if it was rice or something else. You can try one at multiple places in Malaysia, we tried it in Jalan Alor: Writing about it took me back to Malaysia. Feel free to share your Malaysian food stories with me!",

		"Text": "Kurseong is a small town located at an altitude of 4,864 ft. about 32 kilometers from the famous hill station Darjeeling. The actual name of the place was Kharsang meaning &#x201C;Land of the White Orchids&#x201D; in the Lepcha language but over the time it changed and this town is now known as Kurseong.\nKurseong is about 47 kilometres (29 mi) from my home town, Siliguri and is connected to the city by road and the Toy Train, Darjeeling Himalayan Railway.This place is a perfect destination for adventure lovers. There are numerous religious sites, natural sites, museums and treks in Kurseong but despite all this, the one thing that attracts people here are the famous haunting tales.Usually with places believed to be haunted, that is one particular spot that seems to be the center of all supernatural activities. But with Kurseong it is a different story altogether. It seems that this entire hill-station is more or less a ghost town. A haunted building, a haunted road, mysterious forests, sinister treks, headless corpse, ghost of a woman running after people, whispers in the wind, red eyes in the dark, screams of women, mysterious deaths, you name it and Kurseong has got it. Every ghost story, every legend you have ever heard seems to have taken shape here and of course, the locals brag about it so fondly.Out of the many places believed to be haunted in Kurseong, the number one spot can be definitely given to Victoria Boys High School, located on Dow Hill. Surprisingly, this beautiful school is over 100 years old which would probably make it one of the oldest still functional schools in the country. Its foundation was laid by British in the year 1879. There are several stories about this school but all the incidents occur when the entire school is shut-down during vacation between December and March. People talk about how they still hear boys running and laughing in the corridors of the empty building. Some people mention seeing a boy standing at one of the windows, staring at them from the inside while the school was closed for holidays and there was absolutely no chance for anyone to get boxed up in the school.The most sinister story however is of a headless boy who haunts this school and many people claim to have seen it either on the premises or around the building of the school. School administration however, of course, denies all these rumors.Another believed to be haunted spot in Kurseong is Dow Hill and the forest surrounding it. Our headless ghost seems to be present here as well however at Dow Hill he does more than just making an appearance. As per the locals, while walking alone on the roads at Dow Hill, several people found themselves being followed by the headless boy. Later on this ghost would just disappear in the forest but would forever haunt the memories of the person who saw it and the feeling would torment and depress the person so much that it would eventually lead to a suicide. Another thing that Dow Hill is notorious for are the murders and suicides that have taken place here, of which the administration offices have no record.I cannot say that why anyone would believe that Kurseong needed a ghost to be known. This place has already made its mark in the history and is stunningly scenic. The ascent from Sukna to Kurseong comprises of beautiful landscapes, wooded mountains, tea gardens and forest called Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary.So many times I have visited the place with my friends by bike or by Toy Train and stayed at night over there but never experienced any paranormal activities. But as I heard, once a group of people from Systematic Paranormal Investigation, Research and intelligence Team went to the place to investigate and in the mid night investigation, they felt some energy twice and just ran away from the place.One thing that everyone overlooks is that this place is crowded with children, not only the ones that belong here but of other towns too, coming to attend school. These children walk down the same roads, spend their time in the same building but have never been bother, hurt or killed by any ghost ever. How is that possible if indeed this place is so haunted?#Kurseong #Haunted #WestBengal #HauntedStories #Travel #Ghost #Darjeeling #Hills",

		"Text": "The magnificent Phuktal (Phugtal) MonasteryPhuktal Monastery (also called Phugtal Monastery) had been on my mind for a while. But something or the other kept me away from it since 2014. No wonder, inspite of having planned for Valley of Flowers, Hemkund Sahib and nearby areas for my upcoming trip in September, one night, a monk, no older than 8 years, smiled at me in my dreams. I woke up, and knew, that my travel plans are going to change. This was not the first time that my dreams have led me to places and experiences that I&#x2019;ll remember for more than a lifetime. For me, it was a sign to visit the place I had been longing for. And not only this, but to spread smiles there as well.Spreading Smiles is an initiative where I travel to remote places of the country, mostly Himalayas, and do things to bring about a smile on the faces of people. Majorly, I have been distributing educational material, in terms of books and stationary to the underprivileged kids of these regions, and teaching them wherever possible. But this time, I wanted to bring smiles to more people. So, apart from the stationary material, I also carried torches and batteries for the people of Zanskar Valley and Phuktal Monastery, which are still deprived of electricity. Not only this, to be able to make the smiles wider this time, I had also planned to organise an Art Competition for the kids at Phuktal, so carried all the essentials for that well.The stationary material for kids, along with essentials for art competition.And some torches and batteries for villages devoid of electricity We started our journey from Anmu Village at 9 AM. Anmu Village is the last motorable village on the route to Phuktal Monastery, from Padum. It is some 45 KMS from Padum. We had stayed the previous night at Anmu Village only. We drove about 2 kms ahead from Anmu, till the point it was possible, Beyond that the road construction was taking place. BRO is planning to build that road till Cha, the village mid way between Anmu and Phuktal Gompa. We parked our car roadside, and started our walk.We reached Cha Village at around 10:30 AM, and took a leisurely break of an hour there, and continued walking.After a long and a tiring walk, we reached the Monastery Guest house at around 1:40 PM, and admired the beauty of Phuktal. We spoke to the Lama Ji at the guest house and other monks about our plans. We were informed that the kids would get free from their monastic school at Phuktal at 3 PM, and after letting them rest for an hour, we can carry on with our plans.The first view of Phuktal GompaPhuktal GompaAt 4 PM, we started our walk from the guest house to the monastery. Even before we entered it, a couple of young monks got excited upon seeing us. We requested them to take us to their teacher, which they did. We told the teacher about our plans to distribute essential stationary and organise an Art Competition for the kids there. Listening to this, the teacher got really happy as some of the little monks loved to draw and sketch, but did not have the means to do so. He was extremely grateful as this would have been a fantastic break for children from their everyday routine.So many smiles, captured in a single frame. The teacher and the kids at Phugtal.While we were talking to the teacher, many eyes were watching us from upstairs. Some from other rooms. People at Phuktal are not used to Indian tourists visiting them. Curiosity was dripping down from their eyes.As soon as the teacher informed the few kids present there, their eyes sparkled. They rushed to inform all other kids, 36 in total, about the Art Competition. In no time the kids gathered at the common area, with longing eyes. The teacher informed everyone about the competition and the children cheered in joy.The children were really excited upon seeing usWe distributed A3 drawing sheets, pencils, rubbers, sharpeners, crayons, colour pencils, sketch pens, water colours, painting brushes etc. to the kids for them to start. The theme was open because we wanted them to run their imagination wild and create anything they wanted to. Our group also participated in the competition. Soon, the word spread to every corner of the Monastery and a few monks graced us with their presence and joined the kids there.Distributing the essentials for the Art CompetitionThe children and the monks letting their imagination looseWhile the children were creating their masterpieces, I had a long chat with the teacher about the Monastery, the kids, their everyday routine, the life at the Monastery and a lot of other things. I requested to meet the other monks, if possible, and when some more joined us at the common area, I handed them over the torches we were carrying for them. After all, the only source of energy they have is the Solar panels which were installed there just an year back. And torches would have come handy for them in the dark. They smiled and blessed us for our thoughtfulness.All this while, the children, our group and the other monks excitedly kept drawing, sketching and painting their hearts out. Some of them even explained us what they were drawing. After about hour and a half, everyone started submitting their creations to us. And it was time for us to decide the winning entry as we also had a prize for the best entries. It was a hard decision to choose the best one, so, instead, we picked 5, which stood out, and rewarded them with the prizes we had. With every prize, the cheer got louder and louder. And the smile wider.Once it was over, the teacher told us that he did not want this moment to end with the competition. So, he decided to put up all the entries in the classrooms for them to remember and cherish this moment for long. As we left, the kids and the monks smilingly waved us bye. Everyone had a big smile on their faces. Looking at them the little smiling monk from my dreams crossed my mind. Who says, dreams don&#x2019;t come true!A click with the little monks, along with the painting that got the first prize.If you have any questions about Zanskar or Phuktal Monastery, feel free to connect with me on my social media.

Not many know about the beautiful soul who seeded his love, care and all he had to make the place what it is today.Ever since I heard about Narayan Ashram, I asked a few people about how it came up and the story behind it. When I couldn&apos;t find it anywhere, I went there myself, and asked the locals about it.To be very brief, while going for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in 1932, Narayana Swami (Sri Raghavendra) crossed this region of Uttarakhand and realised that the Bhotia Tribe here doesn&#x2019;t have any access to medical facilities, education, sanitation and livelihood. And that&#x2019;s when he decided to change it. He put a halt to his yatra, stayed here and started teaching the people there. He also built educational institutes, medical centres / hospitals and relentlessly worked towards changing the situation the place and the people were in.While staying there, he often used to walk up a little mountain and meditate. That&#x2019;s the place where his Ashram got built in 1936, which was nothing more than a humble cottage then. It is believed that &quot;Unka wahaan dhyaan lag gaya tha&quot;. He sacrificed all his riches, possessions and had out all his efforts towards the growth and development of the people there.Sometime&apos;s I wonder. Was he a Godsend? Or God himself? Now, the Ashram has a school that imparts education and training to the youth. It also has a library, meditation room, samadhi sthal and accommodation facilities for visitors who wish to stay there, at a mere cost of Rs. 600/- which includes all meals. A well marked route to Kailash Mansarovar also begins from there.It is believed that Narayana Swami fell for this place at first sight. And so would you when you visit it.If you are planning a trip to Narayan Ashram, it is advised to spend some time to admire the beauty of the Ashram, of the place, and to interact with the lovely couple who have been taking care of the Ashram for ages. They would love telling you the story in detail.DistancesRoughly around 60 KMS from DharchulaRoughly 150 KMS from PithoragarhRoughly 670 KMS from Delhi",

It is always helpful to have all the must-try food items in one place &#x2013; so here are my top recommendations when it comes to Vietnamese food. Like most southeast Asian countries though, the food is meat heavy and vegetarian or vegan options are rare. Rice noodles is the most common thing to have perhaps, and street food is big. When it comes to street food, it is all about following your nose and gorging on the food like the locals. Vietnamese food is very flavorful, and the taste is enhanced with herb and lime garnishings.1.\tBun Cha &#x2013; probably, the most common food item in Vietnam. Basically, it is rice noodles served with pork and of course herbs and sauces. The vegetarian version of this would however, have some veg spring rolls.2.\tVietnamese Pho &#x2013; This is like a soupy noodle &#x2013; served with a bowl of rice noodles and some flavorful clear soup and ofcourse some meat of your choice. The devil is in the details for this one. I saw the locals add some chillies and lime juice to the bowl, and I followed suit. All of a sudden it tasted out of the world!3.\tBanh mi &#x2013; It is a typical Vietnamese sandwich. From the outside it might look like any other sub or sandwich, but you just have to taste it to know the difference! The bread is crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. In addition to meat of your choice, it is loaded with coriander, onions, and a typical chilli sauce. The one I went for was spicy and made me fall in love!4.\tVietnamese spring rolls &#x2013; you know how any curry in India is served with roti or rice? In a very similar way, all Vietnamese meat / fish are served with rice paper rolls. You can make your own rice paper spring roll, by adding some of the meat, some herbs, and roll it up! Dip it in some sauce and wash it down! The rolls are very fascinating because they look exactly like paper but once you put them in the mouth, they would instantly melt.5.\tCoffee &#x2013; The country is crazy about its coffee. Be it egg coffee or coconut coffee &#x2013; you will find all variants that you can possibly think of! Vietnamese coffee is usually made with condensed milk and as a result is super sweet. The egg coffee is a Hanoi specialty &#x2013; it was invented during the Vietnamese war when there was a scarcity of milk. The froth is made of egg yolk, but surprisingly has no egg smell, may be because of the added vanilla essence.To sum it up, if you went to Vietnam and did not experiment a bit with the local food, you are likely to miss out on more than you can imagine. Vietnamese food is not just delicious but also super inexpensive. A typical meal cost us not more than 100,000 Vietnamese dong or 300 INR or US$ 5 ever. So take the hint, and think about your diet inly when you are back from your vacation!",

		"Text": "&#x2018;Mother Nature has the best box of crayons&#x2019;-AnonymousYou&#x2019;ll know this quote holds absolute truth when you step into Japan. Be it during the Autumn or the Sakura/Cherry Blossom time. Koyo or Momijigari, like they call it in Japan is a tradition of visiting areas during fall-foliage, where leaves have changed their colours. The magic of yellow-orange foliage are sure to take you to a different world altogether. You are sure to leave a piece of your heart behind.\nArashiyama Bamboo GroveHotelsMapExploring Japan would never be enough. The least you could do during your first visit is walking down the lanes of bustling Tokyo, strolling through the scenic grass fields at Hakone, getting meditative in the gorgeous shrines of Kyoto, de-stressing in one of the many gardens, relishing the local Sushi(if you&#x2019;re a sushi fan!) or the Yakitori(the skewered/grilled meat/veggies), enjoying a Sake or a Sh&#x14D;ch&#x16B; with the locals &amp; sleeping in a traditional home.TokyoHotelsMapBest time to see the autumn colours:Allow yourself for a visual treat while smelling the crisp air and soaking yourself in the gorgeous carpets of the fiery red maple leaves. Typically, the autumn foliage season starts in Mid-September. But the forecast varies as per the geographical regions in the country. For eg. Hokkaido which falls in the north, experiences autumn approximately from late September to late October whereas the prime touristy cities of Tokyo &amp; Kyoto show their &#x2018;true colours&#x2019; somewhere between mid-November to early December. So, before you embark on your fall trip to Japan, don&#x2019;t forget to check the autumn calendar of that particular year. https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/japan-autumn-leaves-forecast is the site we referred to check the calendar for our 2017 trip.Daigoji TempleHotelsMapGetting TO JapanTokyo would be the ideal place to start your holiday from anywhere around the globe. There are two airports in Tokyo &#x2013; Haneda &amp; Narita. Haneda is a better bet to land as its closer to the city. Narita has better shopping experience, so maybe you can try flying out through Narita.Getting Around JapanThe Japan Rail pass commonly known as the JR pass is quite pocket friendly &amp; helpful for planning long distance train travel. The pass is valid on almost all trains operated on the nationwide network of JR (Japan Railways) including shinkansen. The minimum number of days the JR pass is available is 7. Also, the validity period is based midnight to midnight rather than 24 hours which means if you start using your pass on noon of day1, it will expire at midnight of day 7 instead of noon of day 8.Suggested Itinerary ( 11 days):Day1: Arrive in Tokyo by eveningDay2-3: Looking around Tokyo&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Shijuku Gyoen&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Yoyogi park&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Shibuya crossing&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Tokyo skytree&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Tokyo tower&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Ueno park&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Sensoji shrineDay4: Nikko National ParkDay5: HakoneDay6-7: Exploring Kyoto&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Daigoji temple&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Kiyomizu-dera temple&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; GionDay8: Arashiyama Bamboo forest &amp; Kinkaku-ji TempleDay9: NaraDay10: Fushimi-Inari-Taisha ShrineDay11: Return to the den!Exploring in &amp; aroundTokyoLiving true to the reputation, the rapid Tokyo-Metro makes it possible to cover a lot of sightseeing spots easily in a day&#x2019;s time. Shinjuku Gyoen &amp; Yoyogi parks are amongst the largest &amp; the most popular parks in Tokyo. While Shinjuku Gyoen is located at a short walk from Shinjuku station, Yoyogi Park is right outside the Harajuku station. Shibuya crossing (the world&#x2019;s most populated crossing), Tokyo skytree &amp; the Tokyo tower are a few touristy places that you can easily add to the day&#x2019;s list. Though Ueno Park is a must visit during the Cherry Blossom season, you can check out the night illuminations at this garden in autumn too.Day 1Shinjuku Gyoen ParkHotelsMapYoyogi ParkHotelsMapTokyo TowerHotelsMapSensoji ShrineTokyo&#x2019;s most colourful &amp; popular temple Sensoji, also known as Asakusa Kannon is located in Asakusa. A vibrant shopping street at the entrance of over 200 meters, called Nakamise leads to the main entrance of the shrine. Don&#x2019;t forget to try the fun fortune teller machine on the right hand side of the entrance. It has a wishing jug that spills out bamboo numbers after you shake it while saying your wishes. After you collect your small paper, read your result and tie to the rack in the temple. But good luck and bad luck could be part of the result. It&#x2019;s fun though!Day 2Sensō-jiHotelsMapPink evenings at Sensoji ShrineNikko national parkIf you have limited time in Japan, an enhancing full day excursion to Nikko can be easily planned as it&#x2019;s accessible within 2 hours from Tokyo by JR or Tobu railways. The lavishly decorated Toshogu Shrine &amp; the Shinkyo Bridge (which stands at the entrance to Nikko&#x2019;s temples &amp; shrines) are the highlights of Nikko. Depending on the weather, you can easily include Lake Chuzenji &amp; Kegon falls to you day&#x2019;s itinerary.Day 4Nikkō Tōshō-gūHotelsMapShinkyo BridgeHotelsMapHakone- One of our favourites!With the serene mountain scenery &amp; the pampas grass fields, you&#x2019;re sure to make a blissful escape from the pacing Tokyo. A relaxing Onsen (hot springs), a cruise ride from the shores of Lake Ashinoko, the mesmerising view from the Hakone Ropeway &amp; a happy ride on the Tozan railways amidst the mountains sums up to a beautiful day at Hakone. On a &#x2018;lucky weather day&#x2019;, you might be able to spot the majestic Mount Fuji from the ropeway too. Don&#x2019;t forget to try the Owakudani Black Eggs here as some locals say, eating those eggs can add seven years to your life. Woohoo!Day 5HakoneHotelsMapHakone RopewayHotelsMapThe Hakone Free Pass by Odakyu Railways can be purchased at major railway stations and ticket counters along the Odakyu Railway Line. It&#x2019;s super pocket friendly as it provides unlimited use of Odakyu-affiliated buses, trains, boats, cable cars and ropeways in the Hakone area. Not to forget, you can get away with the queues at all your stops saving a lot of time too.A thing to remember- Hakone is not accessible through JR, it&apos;s Odakyu Railway that operates between Tokyo&apos;s Shinjuku Station and Hakone-Yumoto Station.&#xA0;Kyoto &amp; Day trips aroundKyoto, the former Imperial capital of Japan, carries a reputation of its rich &amp; cultural heritage. Unless you plan to unwind yourself for a week or more, it&#x2019;s impossible to cover over 400 beautiful &amp; traditional shrines that this city owns. Irrespective of the fact that each shrine is a first&#x2013;rate attraction in its own, here are a few shrines recommended by us that we say are a &#x2018;crime to miss&#x2019; &amp; can be covered within a limited stay-time in Kyoto. Kyoto is also the heart of Japan&#x2019;s geisha world. You&#x2019;re sure to spot many tourists all decked up in rented kimonos, living out their Japanese fantasies.Day 7GionHotelsMapThe Fushimi Inari-TaishaTo top the list, is this head shrine of God Inari, located at the base of the mountain, also named Inari. Famous for its thousands of vermilion gates that lead into the sacred Mount Inari. There are many vermilion-coloured buildings too on your way, souvenir shops and smaller structures selling charms. The Fushimi-Inari is right outside the Inari station which can be reached within 10 mins from Kyoto station by the JR line. Bonus- JR pass works here!Day 10Fushimi Inari TaishaHotelsMapFushimi Inari TaishaHotelsMapDaigo-ji TempleThe autumn views around the Daigo-ji temple, a designated world heritage site, are nothing less than postcard paintings. The Bentendo Hall with the picturesque bridge &amp; lake at its base are a stunning treat to the eyes. This shrine is a 15-min walk or a short community bus ride from Daigo station.Day 6Daigoji Temple Nio-mon GateHotelsMapKiyomizu DeraMake sure to catch the sunset views at the Kiyomizu-dera (literally &quot;Pure Water Temple&quot;) with the sea of fall colours in the backdrop. The easiest way to get here is by bus (number 100 or 206-15mins) from Kyoto main station. Closest stops are Gojo-zaka or Kiyomizu-michi, from where it&#x2019;s a 10 min uphill walk to the temple. The shopaholics have a bonus of finding some cute souvenir shops along the slopes of the temple.Kiyomizu-deraHotelsMapIf you wanna adorn the lovely kimono for a day, you can head to Gion, the geisha town. It&#x2019;s very close to Kiyomizu-Dera. Several shops along the lanes of Gion have professionals who&#x2019;ll do the white make up and help you dress in a bright kimono before a photo shoot! You can also stroll Kyoto for more pictures.Kinkaku-ji templeThis golden pavilion whose top two floors are completely covered in gold leaf is built overlooking a large pond making a stunning view for its visitors. It has burned down numerous times throughout its history but the present structure was rebuilt in 1955.Day 8Kinkakuji TempleHotelsMapArashiyama Bamboo forestsThe majestic bamboo grooves, located on the western outskirts of Kyoto are quite magnificent &amp; make an impressive backdrop for your holiday photos. But, make sure you visit the bamboo alley early in the morning as it gets quite crowded post 8.30am. Arashiyama is less than 30 mins train ride from Kyoto main station &amp; yippie, JR pass works here too!!Arashiyama Bamboo GroveHotelsMapThe photogenic gardens along the Tenryuji temple &amp; the lakeside pathway to the Togetsukyo Bridge are sure to surprise you with Mother Nature&#x2019;s creativity.Lake along the Bamboo forestsLake along the Bamboo forestsNaraA Compact city approximately 35kms from Kyoto. The magical forests, ancient lantern patterns &amp; the walking deer(NARA) make Kasuga Taisha  the most important Shinto shrine in Nara. The autumn sceneries in the Isui-en Garden are attractively serene &amp; not to be missed. The entrance fee to this park is a little heavy on the pockets but it&#x2019;s a definitely worth the visit. The Nara Park &amp; the landmark Buddha at the Todaiji temple can also be conveniently covered in a day&#x2019;s itinerary.Day 9Nara PrefectureHotelsMapLantern patterns at Kasuga TaishaNara ParkHotelsMapNara ParkIsuien GardenHotelsMapIsui-en GardenNara PrefectureHotelsMapShopping!Japan, especially Tokyo is a shopper&#x2019;s paradise. I wouldn&#x2019;t be done even if I was given a week&#x2019;s time. Be it the latest gadgets, the cutest of stationaries or the ever so pretty ceramics, you have it all there. The 100 yen shops which are like the dollar shops, offer everything under the roof. We would recommend Diaso or Seria as the best 100 yen shops that could be found in Tokyo as well as Kyoto.For all the high-street shoppers, Shibuya would be the right place which has a string of brands like Zara, H&amp;M, F-21 and UNIQLO. Shibuya also offers a lot many restaurants that you can a grab a bite at in between your shopping.Our best buys in Japan also include a lot of face masks &amp; creams that we picked from some handmade stores in Gion, &amp; some organic green tea from the lanes of Kiyomizu-Dera (we were not a fan of the Japanese Matcha though).Things to packWith considerble amount of shrines &amp; temples in Japan, it&#x2019;s wise to bring shoes that slip on and off easily unless you enjoy untying and lacing your shoes every few minutes. Acoording to your own tolerance, make sure to pack your hand warmers &amp; thermal leggings if necessary. Neutrals like creams &amp; greys tend to stand out in your pictures against the autumn colors. Velvets look royal &amp; elegant too!AccommodationAlthough accommodation isn&#x2019;t a problem for all kinds of budget, we preferred booking Airbnbs at central locations as we wanted to enjoy an authentic stay.Places we missed, but YOU shouldn&#x2019;t!Kamakura: A day&#x2019;s trip from Tokyo, the great Buddha at Kamakura is second largest statue in Japan after the one in Todaiji-NARA. This place is also known as the Kyoto of eastern Japan due to its various cultural shrines &amp; temples.Hitachi Seaside Park: One of its kinds, it&#x2019;s a stunning park in Hitachinaka, Ibaraki. It&#x2019;s famous for its seasonal flowers- The Park&#x2019;s iconic flower is the blue nemophila during spring &amp; the hill is covered by green kokia bushes which slowly turn red as the weather turns cooler.Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki: Also known as the re-born cities, these places also host some stunning parks &amp; castles. The history lovers can definitely add these to the list.Disneyland: We missed this fun seven themed land as it is located on the outskirts of Tokyo &amp; would have required an entire day to explore it.Day 11ShibuyaHotelsMapAn adorbale Disney store in TokyoHokkaido: Hikers, Skiers, campers, cyclists wouldn&#x2019;t wish for a better heaven than the untouched landscapes of Hokkaido. One place we would definitely go back to Japan for.Picture Courtesy: clicked on iPhone.That&#x2019;s it for now!!! Sayonara!

		"Text": "Life in Coracles at SangamMost travel sites and blogs feature this place when you search for day outings around Bangalore or places within 100 kms from Bangalore. What I would like to do though is to also provide my view of what can one do at this place beyond just spending two hours there on a day trip and returning back. The place has its own charm which is distinct in different seasons and one that calls for different experience every time you visit it. While it is gushing with Kaveri water in the monsoon and post that, it is at its calmest during summer and late winters when one can take a dip in the water and walk through the river bed to the other side.Mekedatu or Sangam as it is popularly known locally is the confluence of river Akravathi and Kaveri. The Akravathi part of the confluence is still for most parts of the year while the river Kaveri flows with immense strength all through monsoon raising the water levels and submerging some flora around. The actual Mekedatu spot is around 5 kms from SangamI first visited the place in 2008 while I was still in college and have fond memories of this place which I refreshed during my last visit. The current truth about this place is that it is no less beautiful than it was back then but since the tourist inflow has multiplied many times, the authorities have had to crackdown on safety of the tourists. As as result, most places that are prone to danger are cordoned off from normal public. This is not necessaryily a bad thing but the adventurer in you may cringe at this sight. It happened to me as well but be rest assured that the place can has more to offer if you are willing to spend time and explore.\nSangama Rivers ConfluenceHotelsMapGetting ThereSangam is around 100 kms from Bangalore and 35 kms from Kanakpura which is the biggest taluk place around. If you are going by road, take the nice road and exit on Kanakpura road. From Kanakpura, take the left road that goes straight to Sangam. The route till Kanakpura is often busy and bustling with vehicles but as you take the road to Sangam the road narrows and becomes scenic with water bodies and tree canopies around. The place is a part of the reserved forest area and you encounter a forest checkpost around 10 kms before Sangam. They charge a Rs 10 fee for bike and around Rs 20-30 for cars to enter the forest area. The last stretch at Sangam is a ghat areas with multiple hairpin bends which may come in as a surprise if you are zooming at a speed of 80+ kmph. If you take the nice road and the highway, it will generally take around 2-2.5 hours to reach Sangam. There are shop vendors and locals ready to ask for money for parking or entry or guiding you. Steer clear and head straight to the Sangam area where you can park your cars and two wheelers.There are 1-2 direct buses to Sangam from Bangalore and many starting every two hours from Kanakpura. The are many buses to reach Kanakpura from Banshankari TTMC bus stand. It will take around 3 hours to reach Sangam by bus if you get the right connections.Things to doIf you are doing a day trip from Bangalore, the most obvious thing to do after getting to Sangam is to take the coracle ride to the other side of Akravathi river and then the bus to the Mekedatu view point. They charge you Rs 50 for a two way coracle ride and then Rs 60 for the view point by bus separate. Its not unusual for the coracle riders to ask for tips over and above. Give them some tip but also ask them to do some simple stunts like going round in water with the small boat and they would most often oblige. The bus ride is no fun if you ask me. The bus is rickety and filled will as many that can breathe inside and often waits for people to come from the other side to start. The ride is bumpy to say the least and will move water in your stomach. There is not much views around but it is still preferable to sit towards the right side while going and left while coming back to get a view of the river as it flows gently in the beginning and suddenly picks speed and turbulence as it enters the gorge. The view point is fenced and cordoned off after some people slipped off and died which doing stunts on the rocks around the river. Let the crowd finish their selfies and then head to the view point to get a peaceful view of the gorge and the surrounding hills. I was told that you cannot walk to this point and need to take the bus but I think you can try doing that if its not too hot and dusty. Packed hours for the coracle-bus-viewpoint trip will be from 10 am to 4 pm. If you can avoid those, please do but if on a day trip there is not much you can do as you need to head back to Bangalore.Mekedatu View Point: River Kaveri in the gorgeIf you are staying over for the night, there are offbeat things to do. One of which is to simply stroll around the river banks on the other side before taking the boat back and watch the sun set over the Sangam. If the weather is good, walk to the view point and back along the river. The flow is strong and with undercurrents. Do not take it lightly though. Do not venture into water in the monsoon. There is a death toll by year mentioned right at Sangam.Early morning at Sangam can give you the best clicks and solitude that cannot come during the day. Spend some time along the river bank. Another thing to do is to venture towards the Galibore nature camp road that heads right just before Sangam. This was the best off road tour we took on that morning. It may seem like going nowhere but be sure to be treated with the most exotic birds and deers around if you are an animal and bird watcher. The 8 km drive to Galibore nature camp is one of the best early morning but one that can be bumpy off roading types. There is a Ved Mahavidyalaya enroute and some other establishments including a small village. The school is a boarding school that combines stateboard syllabus with Veda teachings. You can get in and see the place. Its a good experience to see the kids learn and chant vedas and talk to the authorities about how they run the place.Running in the forest sanctuaryEnroute Galibore campCycling at Galibore CampVed MahavidyalayaOn the way with a slight detour are the Chunchi falls which are 6km one side from the main road to Sangam. The falls are on Akravathi river which runs dry for most part of the year and carries little water towards Sangam. The drive to Chunchi falls is pleasant with well maintained roads but the falls will leave you disappointed. Its way too crowded with day trippers and not worth all the hype that it gets considering that they are close to Bangalore.StayIf you want to enjoy the beauty of the place beyond the crowds that throng it during the day and explore places around, I would suggest to stay over for a night. There is only hotel at Sangam (the KSTDC Mayura run by the Karnataka government). The hotel is an ok place to stay and do not expect anything fancy other than a bed and fan. There is no room service and you need to go to the restaurant for food during the day. They can get you dinner in your room if you wish but you need to order before 7 pm. You can book online for this place and it would typically be around Rs 1-1.2k for an AC room. You may not expect but its hotter at this place than Bangalore and somewhat sultrier too. If you cant withstand the discomfort, go for the AC room.Hotel KSTDC MayuraThe Galibore nature camp is a good though expensive place to stay right on the banks of the river inside the forest. Expect to pay around Rs 5k per person including food and activities for a day. Activities include coracle ride, cycling, other games and trekking in the nearby hills. The camp is well maintained and has tent accomodation that is basic but very good and has all facilities.EatAfter crossing Kanakpura and heading towards Sangam, there arent any food joints to have proper food. Its best to pack some snacks from home or on the way. Even at Sangam the road has fast food joints serving bread omlette, tea and other packed items. They all have fish fried though you are not guaranteed for a fresh catch to be served on your plate.The KSTDC hotel runs a restaurant too that is the only place for travellers to eat while at Sangam if you are looking for having lunch. The restaurant is self service and serves basic food menu at slightly higher than average cost. There is nothing apart from bread omlette here for breakfast.KSTDC Mayura RestaurantKSTDC Mayura MenuThings to carryThe most important thing to carry is food if you can. Light snacks if on a day trip and possibly bread and some other things if going for longer. The place is buzzing with monkeys flying from tree branches and waiting to snatch that packet from your hand. Be careful. Other things to carry may include - slippers to get in water during the summer and later winters, cap as its very sunny during the day, binoculars to spot exotic birds around and most importantly an open mind. Its easy to get disappointed with this place if you are searching for that instagram thing to post from here. Its natural, rustic and basic and thats where its beauty lies.For more details and other travel stories, you can visit my blog here",

It&apos;s not at all dangerous as other may have thought. Its boaring sometimes however excitement takes over boredom most of the time. You get to choose everything and no one will come in between your plans. You meet new people and connect with them and leave small piece of yourself in them.Hence, I am sharing my experience to all those travelers who are hesitating to take the risk and afraid to step out.My journey started on the night of 1st of March. It was Holi festival going on. Fire of holi was burning everywhere. I got the bus at around 11 in the night and I reached Aurangabad at around 7.30.- There are two ways to reach Ajanta Caves. First is relatively simple. Catch a MTDC tour bus which will take you to Ajanta Caves and bring back. The bus is Air Conditioned and run by Maharashtra Tourism. Starting point of the bus is MTDC office near railway station and bus departs at around 7.30. For a day long tour it costs around Rs. 600.-The second option is little bit hectic. You need to go to central bus stop and catch any bus that go to Jalgaon or Bhuswal. I said it would be hectic because finding a seat in State Transport bus is one hell of job. Ajanta is around 100 kms from Aurangabad and takes around 2 and half hours to reach there.- Once you get down at the stop you need to get in the Shuttle bus which takes you to actual caves. Ticket will cost you Rs. 30.- Ajanta caves are spread in semi circular shape. It would require around 3-4 hours to watch all the caves. There are approximately 29 rock cut Buddhist cave monuments.- To get back to Aurangabad you need to go to Fardapur which is 2km away from Ajanta.- There nothing much you can do in the night. I went to Aurangabad&apos;s famous restaurant Yalla Yalla to have their famous biryani and it was finger licking Delicious ????.Day 2Lonar LakeHotelsMap- I woke up 6 in the morning on the next day and left my hotel room at 6.30. Went to Cidco Bus stand which is 6km away from my hotel.- I came to know that the bus which goes to Lonar would leave at 7.30. I had an ample time to observe people around. Everywhere I go I try to observe and learn from the people. They tell you something with their actions and emotions.- Bus started at 7.30. It goe through district of Jalna. Climate was good. Not too hot not too cool. It was dry though unlike Mumbai. It took 4hrs to reach to Lonar.- After reaching Lonar bust stop you need to travel for another 2km to reach at the site.- It was a humongous sight. It acts like a time machine. I was witnessing that event which happened 52,000 years ago.- Lake is almost circular in shape and it has a circumference of about 8kms.The mighty Lonar Lake Day 3ElloraHotelsMapIt was third and last day of trip and I was falling in love with experience I have been experiencing. I chose to roam around the city with the tour bus. The buses are run by Maharashtra tourism board. Every seat costs around Rs.300. They will show important places of the city like Bibi ka Maqbara, Daulatabad Fort, few temples and most importantly Ellora caves. Ellora caves are much larger than Ajanta and may take 4 - 5 hours of exploring. Unlike Ajanta ellora depict Hinduism and Jainism along with Buddhism. Bus will drop you off back to MTDC office by 5pm.      \nBibi ka Maqbara Daulatabad Fort City view I caught the bus at night and came back home next day. That concludes the most memorable and adventurous trip of recent times.Guyz, the reason I said it was memorable because it was one hell of an experience. I overcome fear of spending night alone in hotel room, celabrated a strangers birthday, made new friends. These things will be cherished forever.I urge you to go to a solo trip at least once in your life time. It will surely defined who you are.Travel Buddies I stayed in hotel Holiday era. Paid around Rs 1300 for two nights. Recommended for solo travelers.https://g.co/kgs/ApdNjCFor more information on the cityhttps://kmholidays.in/Follow me on Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/travellingwandererr/",

		"Text": "Among the cloudsAfter a chilling weekend in Daman my instinct was telling me to go on an exploration trip. It was hot and humid month of May and there are very less places to go to. Even though it was horrifying hot one of colleague made a plan to go on a hike(trek). It was none other than Harishandragad. I have been hearing about this fort ever since I started trekking. I didn&apos;t want to miss the opportunity and I said yes. I was excited for another reason and that reason is Kokankada. I only saw the place in the pictures. The thought of going there finally was very exciting.\nPaachnaiHotelsMapWe chose the the easier route that is from Paachnai base village. We started our journey from Dombivali at 7.30. Road was clear with very less traffic. Had one pit stop to have a breakfast at Kasara Ghat for around half an hour. Recommended place is Baba Da Dhaba. They serve delicious Idli - Wada Sambar there. We continued our journey and went past Baari village which is base village for Kalsubai Peak. I climbed that peak last year during Monsoon. We skipped Bhandardara and went via Rajoor village. Last patch of 10 was very rough road it took more than 35 minutes to cover that patch. At last we reach to the base village at around 12.30 pm in hot sunny afternoon.Paachnai is kind of a colorful village. It was a month of May and school were having holidays so interacted with some of the children. We already ordered a villager to make lunch and let me tell you it was awesome. We finished our lunch by 1.30 rested for about 45 min and started our hike by 2.15 and there started our tiring and exhaustive journey...........  \tDream. Explore. DiscoverWe completely underestimated the heat and we paid price for it. Shortly after we started the trek a steep ascend arrived followed by some hundred steps. It slowed us down completely. We were short of breath and sweating like a pig. Took some rest in the caves and had some Lime Water. We continued our hike as we had to reach at the Kokankada by sunset and do tenting. It was around 3.45 and we had hardly covered any distance. We increased our pace as we had no other option. Couldn&apos;t afford to miss the awesome sunset view. To be honest, we had to climb approximately 3km of slope only but the immense heat,dehydration were slowing us down immensely. It took us 2 and half hours to reach on the top of the plateau. We rested for 10 min had Nimbu Paani(Lemon water) (We were high on Lemon Water that day as we literally had 25 glasses of them)and headed to the most thrilling place of my life..........20 min to Kokankada.......Sunset from KokankadaLet me tell you something about Kokankada. It is a cliff semi circular vertically and horizontally. It faces west to the Kokan region. So during monsoons clouds coming from the west, they hit the cliff and travel upwards. If you are extremely lucky you could experience a rainbow of you in the clouds. This is an extreme rare phenomena and is called Brocken spectre or &quot;Indravraj&quot; in marathi.I have never come across such an amazing place. We spent some time on the cliff till the sunset and then we set up our tents. It was off-season so we hardly saw any tents around us. By 9 pm we ate dinner and slept in our sleeping bags.Have you slept on earth the and woke up on heaven on the next day?Well....I did................  \tWhen you wake up to the view like this We woke up at around 6.30 am and started to pack everything. We wanted to leave campsite as early as possible and head towards Taramati Peak which is the highest point of the fort. I saw clouds getting crowded at Naneghat. It was looking like someone tonnes of cotton and forgets to take with them. Within 10 minutes clouds reached till Kokankada and it was lovely view to witness. Clouds were literally jumping from one peak from another.   \tThis continued for another half and hour or so and people have already started gather around the edge. We started our journey to Taramati Peak. It was hardly 20 minutes of ascend. We came down within an hour and started descending. Reached base village within 1 hour and 30 min.   \tDay 1Harishchandragad is situated in Ahamadnagar district approximately 200 kms away from Mumbai. There are 3 ways to reach at the top. One goes through Khireshwar village another goes via Paachnai village and the third one is Nalichi Vaat(Nali&apos;s Path). First two are easier as compared to the later as it requires proper climbing equipments.Day 2KokanKadaHotelsMap",

		"Text": "A green patch of land among the deserted mountains of Spiti is something which is amazing to visit. Mud village is one of the remotest village of Pin Valley. Having a population of around 150-200 people. It&apos;s the starting or ending point of the famous Pin-Bhaba or Pin-Parvati trek. The road to Mud bifurcates from the road linking Tabo and Kaza. 50kms from Kaza, Spiti&apos;s largest town. A drive of 33kms from that bifurcation till Mud Village. Mud is also known as the land of Snow Leopard and Ibex. In winters the temperatures often drop below -10c. In this period the Snow Leopards comes near the village in search of food and shelter. confluence of Pin (centre) and Spiti River (lower left corner) Before Mud comes another village called Sagnam, 11kms before Mud. It is also one of the most beautiful village although it covers a larger area than Mud. The mountains here have different shades of color and accompanied by the beautiful Pin river. The road that takes you to Mud is not a metaled road but it&apos;s not that bad. The breathtaking scenary will take you to a different world. Sagnam VillageColorful mountainsMud has a few home stays for accommodations. One of the most popular among them is the Tara Home Stay. An old typical mud Spitian roof with the local painted colors on the wall. Also there&apos;s one newly built Pin-Parvati Home Stay, which is comparatively the latest built structure with modern amenities and descent rooms and food. I stayed here and the view from the roof is amazing. It somewhat looks like this.There&apos;s a trail that will take you to the Pin river down below the village. You can either ask the local people or you can figure out the trail yourself. It begins between two houses it begins and goes down the slope through the agricultural lands and few nullas (water streams)This trail will help you witness some amazing landscapes. People rarely walk through this, but I&apos;ll definitely advice you to do so. A bridge is there which will take you across the flowing Pin river. It is commonly used by the local people. They use to go to their houses or while going across the banks for farming or other activities.Local people crossing the bridgeThe bridge that hangs over the mighty Spiti riverHere in Spiti or Ladakh if you wish people by saying &quot;Julley!&quot; which means good wishes, good morning, good day etc in Tibetan language, they&apos;ll reply with a face full of smile and say &quot;Julley!&quot; in return. I met some local people and talked to them about their day to day lives. The view of the valley from here is breathtaking. The river and the mountains on both the sides give you the perfect frame to capture a picture. Mud has the one of the clearest sky to stargaze. The milky way is completely visible in naked eyes. It looks like clouds but no it&apos;s the milky way! After dinner at around 10 o&apos;clock I went to the roof of the home stay. Took my tripod and my camera. It took me few seconds to compensate my eyes. Then I got to see the milky way. It was hell of an experience!! The next moment I fixed the tripod and mounted my camera to take some shots of it. See the result belowThe next morning my plan was to move to Kaza from Mud. I packed my luggage and set out for Kaza!Overall Mud is an excellent place, you all should visit if you&apos;re in Spiti. Reaching MUD:For &quot;solo traveler/Budget travelerIf you&apos;re coming from Manali side, take a bus from Manali to Kaza by HRTC, then from Kaza to Mud by a shared cab or by hitchhiking. ORFrom Shimla you can take a bus from Shimla to Reckongpeo then change the bus. Take the bus to Kaza from Reckongpeo bus stand. Get down at the bifurcation and wait for vehicles heading towards Mud or Sagnam.For FamilyYou can hire a cab from any location and reach Mud.Follow my blog and Instagram for more updates.By-Tirthankar Ghosh",

		"Text": "Garbett PlateauHotelsMapEver since I relocated to Mumbai for my new job role, I was looking forward to exploring the Western Ghats. My first trek was to the beautiful RajMachi Fort. Two weeks later I went to explore the Garbett Plateau.Must carry things for the trek include Water Bottle, Snacks/Fruits, Glucose/Energy Drink, Chocolates(for the village children), Change of Clothes, Windcheater/Poncho, Towel and a pair of Trekking shoes (with good grip).The best way to reach the starting point for the Garbett Plateau Trek is to take the Mumbai Local from CST to Bhivpuri road station (in the Central line)- Travel time is 2 hours. From here take an autorickshaw to drop you at the starting point. Vishnu (8983739400) was the autorickshaw driver for us and his knowledge of the area was simply amazing. We were dropped off at a little village from where we started the ascend.The path for the trek is fairly well marked, albeit a few areas. But there are several small farming villages along the way to ask for direction. The path is a little steep on some parts and a bit challenging every now and then. But two hours is decent time to reach the Garbett Plateau. The view from here is mesmerizing and makes you fall in love with it on the first instant.From Garbett plateau it takes another 30 minutes to reach the Garbett Point. On touching this point, a sense of joy and accomplishment takes over. With the view of the Garbett Plateau on one side, multiple Waterfalls on the other and the Bhivupri Lake down below makes the 2.5 hours climb uphill totally worth it.From here it takes another thirty minutes of brisk walking on a flat surface to reach the T- junction- to the left is the market of Matheran and to the right is the shared taxi stand. There is also a Toy Train service available here to reach Matheran. From the Shared taxi stand it costs Rs. 80 per head to reach the Neral Railway Station and from here the Local train takes you back to CST in another 2 hours.Overall my trekking experience in the Western Ghats has been amazing and mesmerizing. The beauty and glory of Mother Nature can best be viewed and experienced via such treks.#Trekkers4Life #VeganIndianBackpacker #YOLO #OneLife #NoRegretsP.S: Pics at the end of the blog :) :)",

Here&#x2019;s how I did you one better: A week long power-packed Greek itinerary handmade for you.Day 1,2: SANTORINI Cruising:You can start off your day with a early morning cruise on a sailboat, there are fixed packages (you can check at your hotel), and get onto a cruise on a sailboat that takes you around to Red Beach, and a few hot springs near volcanic eruptions.Lunch at Ammoudi Bay - it&apos;s a 2km steep walk down from Oia. They have cute little cafes by the harbour which serve local delicacies - I&apos;d recommend a savoury crepe from the Hungry Donkey! Side note: Ammoudi Bay has great spots for cliff jumping.Sunset: You can head back up to Oia/ or take a bus to Fira (a 20 minute drive) or Imerovigli right in time to catch a glorious, orange sun setting into the Adriatic Sea. Don&apos;t forget to try some of the local beer - I&apos;d recommend the Volkan Blonde.Nightlife &amp; Shopping:Fira is a fabulous area to visit for a couple of drinks, dancing and shopping. There are open-air beach bars along the Promenade where the party goes on all night. Momix serves up some yummy cocktails if you want to get right to it.The souvenir shops in Oia are over-price compared to the ones at Fira. A must-buy would be the Donkey Milk soap, and pretty much all things Olive Oil! Side note: The Parathiri Caffe at Fira serves the BEST iced Freddo Cappuccino you could image. And you can pick up some really nice handmade souvenirs - we found cute little Santorini themed mason jars and wine bottles.Day 3: AthensWe had a one day stop at Athens - to soak up all the cultural experiences the Capital had to offer. We picked up the multi pass from the Main entrance of the Acropolis, which allows entry into almost all the historic sites in Athens. The pass is for 30 euros, and it allows access to: The Acropolis, Olympieion, Agora, Hardian&apos;s Library, Temple of Olympian Zeus, and a bunch of museums. The Acropolis and the Temple is a definite to-do.Lunching and Shopping: A one day sightseeing trip can be quite taxing and that calls for some exquisite recovery-meal delicacies. Head to Plaka (15 minutes walk from Acropolis), to cool off and replenish with some greek deliciousness. Some of the Tavernas have an outdoor setting, which is great because you get the aroma of some amazing food and you can people gaze. The freshly squeezed mint strawberry smoothie served at any taverna literally brings you back to life after an exhilarating but exhausting morning in the heat.You can also pick up a few souvenirs at the shops in Plaka. In the evening, head to Monastiraki Square for the flee markets and cordon of stores where you can pick up local Greek artifacts and ofcourse, espresso beans!Day 4,5: KefaloniaWelcome to the best corner of the entire world. White sand and pebble beaches, azure water, gorgeous aerial views, beaches in the middle of mountains, limestone caves, all of these are few of the highlights of this charming little island. Kefalonia makes for the best postcards and polaroids, but most importantly, the fondest memories. Hike up to the peak of Mount Ainos National Park for an early morning sunrise shenanigan and you can watch the sun ascent out from the Aegean Sea.Make an evening pitstop to Atisamos or Myrtos beach and encounter the calming turquoise waters. The multi shaded seas that lay by an endless strip of dramatic beauty perched between mountains, calls out to all aesthetic lovers. End your Kefalonia love affair at a night out by the harbour at Sami, and be sure to visit &#x2018;The Mermaid&#x2019; for dinner to experience some of the tastiest food, friendliest staff and peaceful view the ships that are docked out.Day 6,7: Zakynthos:I&#x2019;m not a big fan of the cliche, so we decided to take a two hour ferry ride out to Zakynthos, instead of one of the more obvious choices. Zakynthos, though a cauldron brimming with charm, has its secrets kept well hidden. We stayed at this gorgeous (but surprisingly reasonable) villa called Hotel Varres. I highly recommend the place if you&#x2019;re looking for something relaxing and semi-grandiose, after 5 nights of airbnb-ing it out. The first thing to do is really a no brainer. You say Zakynthos, I says Navagio! A ferry ride out to Blue Caves and Navagio Beach is the first thing we did. And the sight is definitely a pleasing one. Another obvious is Cameo Island, which is all the way on the other end from Navagio, but worth the two hour drive.Cameo island is entirely a world of its own. You walk over a wooden walkway and you cross around the front-facing side only to make your way into a small little bubble of your own. There are bars on the beach, and they serve up some mojitos that you can sip on with your feet up, whilst enjoying the shade of a wooden hut. You&#x2019;ve got yourself some lively music, salt in the air, drink in your hand and nature&#x2019;s tanning bed - I couldn&#x2019;t think of a more relaxing way to end the day.You could also head out of Cameo earlier, and you reach right onto Laguna Beach, which is like a mini Walking Street of it&#x2019;s own. For Day 2 we have a fun morning either at Porto Limnionas or Porto Vromi, both of which are a stunning, secluded patch of sea surrounded by lush greenery on two sides. This followed by a shopping spree at Rouga Square, and then some fancy ol&#x2019; wine and dine at Keyoneri, Old Town is what you need to bring a fabulous ending to Summer In Greece!",

		"Text": "While fixing the burst tyre at Sankoo, the puncture guy asked me why I did not get it fixed at Kargil. On casually telling him that I didn&#x2019;t go to Kargil, but took the Umba La route to Sankoo, he stopped his work, and looked at me in utter disbelief. It startled me for a moment. He left the tyre, called out a guy working in the Timber shop on the opposite side of the road, and shouted, &#x201C;Ye Umba La se aaye hain!&quot; (He has come via Umba La).4 men walked to me, and questioned me, &#x201C;Aap Umba La se aaye hain?&quot;(Have you come via Umba La).I nodded. While they were still looking at me in disbelief, one of the boys stopped a truck passing by, and told the driver, &#x201C;Ye Umba La se aaye hain&quot; (He has come via Umba La). The truck driver too looked at me in disbelief and drove on. I started to wonder the mystery behind it. But the lack of time made me request the puncture guy to fix my tyre, so that I could proceed with my journey.The open grassland enroute Umba LaDriving at the green pastures enroute Umba LaBefore the tyre got fixed, a few others came to me and asked, &#x201C;Aap Umba La se aaye hain?&#x201D; Everytime I nodded, people looked at me in some disbelief, and either started further questions, or left, still looking at me. It seemed to be the news that amused everyone around. Everyone passing by, looked at me from head to toe, looked at my car. I started to feel, maybe am an alien who has come from a unknown land. Or maybe there&apos;s something really fishy going around there.The roads leading to Umba LaThe roads leading to Umba LaAfter the tyre got fixed, I wanted to give the car for a wash. I halted at a shop to ask about the car wash centre. Instead of telling me the way, he offered to take me there. Such a helpful soul he was. As soon as he sat in the car, he asked me, &#x201C;Aap hi hain jo Umba La se aaye hain?&quot; (You&#x2019;re the same guy who came via UmbaLa?). As soon as I heard that, I almost lost control of the wheel. The news seemed to have travelled across the length and breadth of Sankoo.While giving the car for the wash, even the workers there surprisingly asked me, &#x201C;Aap Umba La se aaye hain?&#x201D; Now it was getting a bit too much for me to absorb. The view of Drass, enroute Umba LaWhen I reached the guest house where we were staying, some other car had parked itself there. Parking was tricky. But thanks to the 3 men sitting there, who helped me park by shifting a bike and stones here and there. As soon as I got out of the car, and even before I could thank them, I heard a familiar question, &#x201C;Aap Umba La se aaye hain?&#x201D;By this time, the whole suspense made the patient soul inside me question back. I asked them about the big deal about having come from UmbaLa.That&apos;s when they told me stories and I understood.Ever since the road has been built from Drass to Kargil to Sankoo (and it&apos;s a long way back), none has taken that route. It&apos;s a no man&apos;s land. Weather changes there every few minutes. Some people have tried going there for fun, but returned with stories of how their car / bike wasn&apos;t able to take the route, and made them return from a few kilometers.They told me, how lucky I am to have visited that part as even the locals of Sankoo have not been there. The only thing they know about UmbaLa is that it&#x2019;s a no man&#x2019;s land, a place that has no roads, and a place they yearn to visit. Surprisingly, UmbaLa is less than 40 KMS from Sankoo. Google Maps show it to be just 12.6 KMS. Guess, need to go again to confirm.And what&#x2019;s more surprising is the presence of another pass before UmbaLa that people do not know about. A pass that still doesn&#x2019;t have a name. A pass that warmly welcomed us with a snowfall.Snowfall at the unnamed mountain pass, in the month of September.Shivering in the snowfall. But, ek selfie toh banti hai.In 2014, I discovered an unknown, unnamed lake in Himachal. In the far corners of Spiti to be precise. Fellow travellers and friends lovingly named it &quot;SS Tso&quot; (after my initials). It was apparent that after posting about this incidence, about the unnamed pass before UmbaLa, a lot of friends and fellow travelers suggested to name the unnamed pass too as &quot;SS La&quot;. Guess, I&#x2019;ll pass that.Connect with me or follow my journeys on Instagram , Facebook , Twitter",

The route though Lower Lohar Khet, Upper Lower Khet and summit Dhakuri Top; 14 kms uphill with birds racket and beautiful falls.

At khati we stayed in a trekker&#x2019;s hut. Khati is last village in this route, it&#x2019;s very organized small village.Next day towards Phurkia, inaccessible route but unique scenic beauty.

We have started very early morning, dark road, we walk with lamp in land, can&#x2019;t see clearly. Then slowly slowly golden sun rises from the slopes of icy mountain.

		"Text": "If you are following me on Instagram, you all know, I have recently visited Alibaug. Yes I know, its monsoon and off-season but sometimes, we find more beauty in off-season, don&apos;t we?I have loved every bit of my journey to alibaug from pune and scenic lush green Lonavala and Khandala passing by.Getting ThereYou can book any bus both Ac or Non-Ac through makemytrip or redbus and easily can board the bus from your decided bus point at pune. It takes 4 hours approximately to reach Alibaug from pune. I have boarded an early morning bus and thereby had the whole day to roam at leisure. Other option is you can rent your own car and drive till alibaug or rent a car service which will be a bit costly though in comparison with bus or self-driving.Places to VisitAlibaug Beach during july end is totally flooded by arabian sea and you will not be seeing any glimpses of fort or seashore. But there are plenty places to sit and spend hours witnessing the turbulent arabian sea and its beauty. I stayed at nagaon bandar road and it takes around 15-20 minutes to reach alibaug beach.Kashid Beach was cleaner than the Kihim beach but it will take time to reach there some 80 kms up and down so have enough time in your hand. Due to monsoon, I found the beach empty, just few families and boys playing around. But otherwise, this place is very happening hosting all kinds of water sports all season except monsoon due to high tide in the sea. There will be few websites and blogger suggesting KIHIM BEACH as a must see place but I completely deny so and it was very dirty and I recommend all to tick out the beach from our wish list, while at alibaug.The next place that I went for is Karmakar Museum which was an offbeat option to visit but I am glad, I did so. It is just 20 kms away from alibaug main town and a bit tricky to reach amidst little suburban locales of alibaug but that&apos;s the beauty of nature that you will never get bored. Google maps does a good job here, helping you reach the museum through winding roads. The exhibition is open all days and entry fee is just Rs10/- which is very nominal, given the quality of sculpture, you will see inside. It is housed inside a quaint yellow bunglow, house of late Scupltor Mr. Nanasaheb Karmakar.Other than all these beaches and museum, you can also visit another beach called &apos;Nagaon beach&apos;. Since I have stayed at Nagaon area only, it was just ten minutes walking from my resort and its worth going, probably the only beach is which is too clean to be true. We went around at 10am after breakfast and it was only me and my friend there and few more fishermen and a lady sitting. There are no shacks or food stalls during monsoon atleast. You can just sit there for hours and enjoy the pristine secluded hidden away beach,all to yourself.I did want to go to KIKI&apos;s corner for lunch or breakfast but due to shortage of time and off-route from my place of stay, I could not but I have heard great feedback and bonus also overlooks the arabian sea. So do try the place if you are there for few days and so.I will soon be posting my resort review where I have stayed and if you have any further queries about your visit to alibaug, shoot me a mail or follow me at Instagram and message me as I will be more than happy to sort out your next travel plan.LOVE RITU.\nKarmarkar MuseumHotelsMapKashidHotelsMapKashid Beach at sunsetKashid BeachHotelsMapAlibaug BeachHotelsMap",

Been two years we last met and here we are heading to Pune for our first trip.On the way to Pune from Chennai I witnessed a beautiful sunrise, something good about taking an early morning flight. Taking an early morning flight saves the day. as you land you are ready to explore the place.Day one itinerary has Trek to Singhad Fort. Initially we decided to go by bike but owing to bad weather we took a cab to Singhad. We were ready with our shoes and windcheater for a rainy trek. There was light showers and all hazy around, we could only see green patches between the fog. We climbed the fort and reached the tip, the wind was blowing at 100km/hr and suddenly realized we were wet. Due to high intensity of the wind we didn&#x2019;t realized the rain showers. It was superb weather with rounds of rain and cold breeze. The path was slippery with water flowing all the way. To take away cold we had hot pit-bhakari, missal pav and yummy onion pakoda, all maharastrian special. On the way back we stopped at Khadakwasla dam, as we have ascended down the hill we could feel the warmth of the sun. The trek was easy with more of relishing the light shower and walking in the clouds.We may not talk often but the bond remains the same, the understanding and trust is unbreakable.

		"Text": "Day 1LehHotelsMapWait for two years is finally over, we are off to the &#x2018;Land of Passes&#x2019;. For the time constraint we decided to fly to Leh from Delhi instead riding bike from Manali. Road from Manali to Leh is one among the most beautiful roads in India but riding via Rohtang pass may get challenging with tough weather conditions and less populated areas.We boarded the early morning flight from Delhi, as we crossed the Delhi territory and flew over to J&amp;K, the landscape changed down under. From concrete jungles to the snow capped mountains. The sun rising above the horizon from under the clouds striking the snow and illuminating the scene.The guide was waiting for us at airport, the Leh airport is operated by Army and has tight security norms. On the way to hotel we can see the Mountain range all around and clear sky with chill wind flowing down the window panes. Our hotel was outside the city periphery, which makes it more peaceful and calm, the room window has a view of snow capped mountains and clouds casting a shadow on land.Leh is 11480 ft above sea level, to acclimatize to the high altitude and low level of oxygen rest is necessary on day one, drinking lots of water and also taking Diamox are advised before and during the trip.After rest we headed to explore market in evening, Street side you can see ladies selling apricot fruit, carrots and some other fresh fruits/vegetables. You can shop for jewelry, souvenir, artifacts, woolen clothes to shoes; also there is Tibetan market from where you can shop for some antique locks, Buddha statues or the Tibetan bells. The things that tempted me most were Pashmina and Yak wool shawls and there were also beautiful embroided shawls, bulk of antique jewellery and hair sticks you cannot avoid to take off your eyes, bit of bargain is sufficient to get you the right price.We tried on some local foods like Kashmiri kawa (a mix of kawa tea, saffron, cardamom and cinnamon) and Thukpa (Tibetan dish with noodles).The day two started with going around the places in Leh. Make sure to keep sipping water(we used tang to keep hydrated). The sun rays are harsh at this altitude so carry sunscreen and sunglasses to protect your eyes. The early mornings and evenings are cold so carry along jacket for protection from cold breeze.Hall of Fame- A place to feel Pride: It is a museum constructed by the Indian Army in memory of the brave Indian soldiers who laid down their lives defending the motherland in the Indo-Pak wars. You can see the memorabilia, eminent defense personalities with biographies, images and weapons used during the Kargil and other key strategic battles fought in Ladakh. And belongings of the enemy soldiers found at war site. All the martyr and the gallantry awards. Also there was a picture of MS Dhoni in army uniform taken during his visit to Leh.Spituk Gompa: It is at the top of hillock striking a panoramic view of the Indus Valley. Prayer flags flutter all around the place. Gompa also houses a collection of ancient masks, antique arms, and an awe-inspiring image of Mahakaal. The face of the Kali image is kept covered and is revealed only at the annual function at January every year. We sat inside the gompa for a while, you can feel the peace within you.Magnetic Hill: Defying the law of gravity. It has been noticed that when a vehicle is parked on neutral gear on this metallic road the vehicle slides up-hill.Gurudwara: Built in the everlasting memory of Shri Guru Nanak Deve Ji the great prophet who sanctified the place by his sacred visit during the year 1517. It is run by Army official.Confluence of Zanskar and Indus: On way to Sham Valley before Nimu village one can have this magnificent view of two rivers, they have different colors and flow. You can also go rafting here.We are already engrossed in the beauty of Leh with some more picturesque view on the way, we next stops at Nubra Valley, Khardungla and the mesmerizing Pangong Tso.

		"Text": "MahabaleshwarHotelsMapStarting from Pune for our trip, we took Pune-Mumbai expressway. One of the finest roads of India, driving under the hills through lighted tunnels, green landscapes all around and cool breeze flowing down the car window.Our first destination was Panchgani famous for its Table Plateau, Asia&#x2019;s second longest mountain plateau. Table land was a vast flat expansion with a Devil&#x2019;s Kitchen cave. We spend some time capturing the scenic view and clicking pictures.Next stop was Mapro Garden which is famous for strawberry festival and you can buy their fresh factory product from here. We stopped on the way to see the chocolate factory and bought some products. It was already evening and we are yet to touch Mahabaleshwar. Running out of time we decided to visit Elphinstone Point and Lingmala waterfall. Due to no visibility at Lingmala we went to dhobi fall. It was a small waterfall but wide enough and water was flowing with great intensity. You can hear the sound of the water rushing down the track.With the help of sign boards we reached the Elephant Head Point, it was too foggy with minimum visibility around. We could not see the elephant head but going down the steps it was like you are walking among the clouds. No crowd at the place makes us hear even the cricket voice and the trees rumbling.It started getting darker and more difficult to drive through. We had our dinner and some shopping at Mahabaleshwar market, nice cheap place to buy stuffs. The market is full of foot wares from all part of India, bamboo and jute craft and embroided kurtis. We headed back to hotel to rest and start for next destination.",

		"Text": "Mesmerizing Blue LagoonDay 5LehHotelsMapIn Continuation to the Ladakh trip......Day 5I have been envisaging the beauty of Pangong Tso around two years after first I saw this place in a travel show and fall in love at first sight. For me the Ladakh trip was all about seeing the beauty of Pangong.We started in the morning by 6:00am, it was a 5hrs journey to the lake and we have to return before the sunset as the roads are rough and at most places single lane. Also it was only a week past the Dokhlam incident. On the way we could see the army camps and the army trucks passing by, we crossed approx. 100 trucks. We passed Chang La, the place to the world&#x2019;s largest research station passing the steep and slushy roads.Pangong LakeHotelsMapPangong Tso is the world&#x2019;s highest brackish lake situated at 14,256ft and is 134km, it extends from India to China. An inner line permit is required to visit the lake as it lies in Sino-Indian Line of Control. It falls in the disputed territory. The eastern end of lake is in Tibet.On the way, before touching the Pangong we can see the Yaks, the Pashmina Goats and Kiang(wild asses) grazing in herds around the grassland. We also spotted the Marmot, the large squirrel species. As we approached the lake, a sheet of vivid blue in the midst of mountains attracted our eyes. The water sparkles in distinct shades of blue, green, violet and purple, being transparent to a good depth. The lake does not support vegetation or aquatic life however many a large variety of migratory birds like sea gulls, brahmani ducks can be spoted.ChanglaHotelsMapBeauty of Pangong Tso cannot be described but can only be experienced. The lake mesmerizes one and all with its shimmering beauty. In simple words, we can say Pangong Lake is &quot;Turquoise Blue Paradise&quot;.The trip has come to an end and we are on way back with the memories of ladakh, the fascinating landscapes and the color changing Pangong. The trip has left us aww stuck with the beauty of nature, the place is beyond imagination.https://espirituelibre.blogspot.com/2017/08/breathtaking-view-of-pangong-tso.htmlPc: https://www.instagram.com/mahtoeakansh/https://www.facebook.com/clickby.eakanshmahto/",

We started early in the morning, the journey has got some beautiful landscape. We crossed many hills, riding up and down, from the Naked mountains the view is slowly transforming to snow laden hills. The increase in chillness and snow being visible was clear indication that we were nearing the Khardungla Pass, the Highest Motorable Road(18,380 ft). The pass is fluttered all over with the Prayer flags with people posing for a pic under the sign board to keep everlasting memory of clinching the top, the sun rays were illuminating the snow turning it into white pearl. We parked only for 20min (recommended 15min) owing to less oxygen supply at the top, there are army hospitals for any emergency situations if any.\nDay 3Khardung LaHotelsMapDiskit GompaHotelsMapFrom Khardungla we descend and travel to Diskit village, most of the areas are barren hills and lands without any greenery. At some places ice melting water is flowing in small streams with green patches around them. On the way near Khalsar village there are ATV rides, it was not less than a roller coaster ride in the sand dunes along the Shokya river on one side.Diskit Monastery this is one of the oldest and largest Buddhist Monastery in the Nubra Valley. There is a big statue of Maitreya Buddha also called as Jampa. The road to monastery starts from market place to the hill top. We stopped by for Lunch and again started travelling the flat barren desert road to Nubra Valley.Hunder Sand DunesHotelsMapAs you enter the valley there is Sand dunes on one side and mountains on the other, the tiny streams melting snow sparkling on the hills.Nubra ValleyHotelsMapWe headed direct to our stay which was a cottage between the trees and hills. The sound of water flowing next to our cottage can be heard, the sound was not only soothing to the ears but was a relaxing therapy for our tiresome souls.Evening we visited Hunder sand dunes, it is one of the highest altitude desert in the world. This place has a very scenic view to it as it is surrounded by mountains all around. Like an oasis amidst the cold desert, Hunder Sand Dunes are beautiful beyond imagination.Here you see the Bactrian Camels and Pashmina Goats. We took a safari on the Bactrian camel around the desert looking at the sun drowning under the hills leaving a beautiful red-orange sky. We got lucky to witness the Tibetan dance form being performed for the tourist. The ladies were laden with silver jewelry and beautiful traditional dress.We are back to our cozy beds after a long day, the sound of water flowing, the cricket and other insect can be heard clearly as there was immense peace here, away from the honking and hustle bustle of city.We have travelled from plains of Leh to snow capped mountains of Khardungla and then descending to the sand dunes of Nubra all in a day journey. The landscapes changes every now and then, leaving you marveling to the beauty of it and speculating for what next to come, each sight is stunning in itself.The day four started amidst admiring the beauty of the sun rising the horizon. We spend some time relaxing around and exploring the flora around the cottage, was at the time to see the apricots hanging down the trees. After breakfast we started our journey back to Leh. We could not stop ourself from stopping again at Khardungla Pass.Next day we travel to our last stop of the trip, the mesmerizing blue lagoon..........Continue https://espirituelibre.blogspot.com/2017/08/breathtaking-view-of-pangong-tso.htmlPc: https://www.instagram.com/mahtoeakansh/https://www.facebook.com/clickby.eakanshmahto/",

		"Text": "Traveling alone is usually scary, especially the first time. We think that something dangerous can happen to us, that we will not be able to understand ourselves with the locals that we will feel lonely, and that it will be difficult to meet people ... are you looking for what you need to know when traveling alone? But it&apos;s not like that! Obviously, there are certain risks linked to traveling, but they are not much greater than going alone. Also, if you miss having company, you can always meet people at your destination (we&apos;ll show you that it&apos;s easier than you think). And you already know that the advantages of traveling unaccompanied are endless: you can enjoy the freedom to choose your own path without having to give explanations, doing and undoing at will; It will allow you to know yourself and incredible people, and in the end you will live an experience of those that change your life. Here are some tips by HolyCity.org to get it in the friendliest way possible:&#xF0D8;\tIf you are going to visit several different countries, buy a free mobile to be able to put a local SIM of each place. You will save money and you can always be connected when you need it. &#xF0D8;\tTake a lock to close your backpack, especially if you go to sleep in common rooms with strangers. It will also be useful to have a chain to tie it to the bed or something similar, especially if you carry things that look valuable from the outside (like laptop cases).&#xF0D8;\tScan your passport and important travel documents and send them to your email. This way, if you get lost, you can easily make copies.&#xF0D8;\tIf you get into a taxi and you are afraid that you will make a long route, look for yourself in Google Maps. This way you will see where it is going if it deviates a lot, and how long it should take to arrive. &#xF0D8;\tThe hostels, the hostels, and the bed &amp; breakfast are better than the hotels to meet other people traveling alone. Spend time in the common areas and you will see how friendship arises&#xF0D8;\tIf you do not like to eat alone, do mealsurfing. You can start looking for restaurants with communal tables.",

		"Text": "Location- Ayodhya Hills in the Purulia District of West Bengal.How to reach- By Train, The nearest railhead is Barabhum Station. By road, you can reach Baghmundi (which is the nearest village connected by public transport) via Kharagpur and Balarampur via State Highway 5. You can also take a slight longer detour via Durgapur, Purulia and reach Baghmundi but the roads would be better. One can take a bus (Which Rarely ply) or a rented vehicle from Baghmundi to Ajodhya Hills.Best time to visit- Between October to April. Less Rains and moderate temperature with a blue clear sky.What to do- Trekking, Rock Climbing, sight seeing and a cultural walk through Santhal tribal Village.\nAjodhyaHotelsMapAyodhya Hills or as the locals call it Ajodhya Pahar are extensions of the Eastern Ghats range (Dolma Hills of Jharkhand). These hills are an abode of several deep forests and beautiful waterfalls. A culturally rich tribe of Santhals finds their habitat amidst these dense forests. They are one of the largest Schedules tribes of India. Baranti, Bheti, Muradi are some small tribal villages nested inside these beautiful landscapes.As per local legends Lord Ram and Sita, stayed here during their exile. Sita was thirsty. To quench her thirst, Rama shot an arrow right through the earth&apos;s crust, out of which water gushed out. The presence of Sita Kund validates this truth. Sita Kund is situated in Bagandi Village.History- Santhals at Ajodhya Pahar region are descents of a Pre-Aryan tribe and were great fighters during British India Regime. Tilka Majhi, Sidhu Murmu, Kanhu Murmu and Birsa Munda were the greatest among the Santhal warriors who led a strong Santhal Rebellion against Britishers.Culture- Santhalis or as they call them Santal people in Ajodhya Region are laborious and hardworking. Women also plays important roles in all household activities.Dance and music has always been an important part of their fairs and festivals. They relax themselves after a hard working day with light music and dance.Karam is their famous yearly festival usually celebrated in the month of September / October.      \nTirio (A flute with seven Holes), Phet Banam (A three stringed fretless instrument), Bohok, hotok etc are some innovative musical instruments used by Santal People to produce an exquisite array of musical notes. Very soothing and calm.Religion- The Santal People follow Sarna Religion. Marang Buru which literally means a Big Mountain is worshipped in Santals as the Supreme source of power. Which doesn&apos;t possess any shape,face,idol. Marangburu is worshipped in the shape of nature.Sarna Religion- An interesting Story of Its Origin Santals had gone to the forest for hunting and they started the discussion about their &apos;Creator and Savior&apos; while they were taking rest under a tree. They questioned themselves that who is their God? Whether the Sun, the Wind or the Cloud?Finally, they concluded that they would leave an arrow in the sky and wherever the arrow would target that will be the God&apos;s house. They left an arrow in the sky; it fell down under a Sal tree.Those men came and yes got the same arrow to that Sal tree.Then, they started worshiping the Sal tree and named their religion as &apos;Sarna&apos; because it is derived from word &apos;Sar&apos; which means arrow in Santali.Occupation- The Santhals from Ajodhya Region mostly rely on forests. They are mostly involved in cattle rearing, wooden crafting, mat-basket making, hunting, fishing and agriculture.The Ritual of hunting Ajodhya celebrates an annual Hunting fest in which the Santal People from Orissa, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh reach Ayodhya for hunting.The Hunting is allowed by the government for this single day to all parts of ajodhya pahar area except few prohibited areas.The train tickets are waived off for this day to facilitate people reach ajodhya.There is a famous saying that:&quot;The Lady who has never been to Chakoltore fest in Puruliya, can&apos;t be called a Lady. Similarly a Man who has never hunted in Ajodhya doesn&apos;t qualifies to be called as a Man.&quot;       \nA local Santhali Narrating the rituals of Hunting at Ajodhya Pahar Area.The Purulia Pumped Storage Project It is a power project with 225*4=900MW capacity situated in Ayodhya Hills. Murugama Dam presents a scenic view of this forest. The clear blue sky and the lush green forests makes this place a photographic paradise for enthusiasts.Bamni and Turga FallsTurga FallsBamni fallsThese falls are situated on the way to Baghmundi from Ajodhya. The stepping water and colorful mosses grown around the rocks makes the waterfall a picturesque view.The Ajodhya TrekThis is a two days trek with moderate risk level. The trek starts from Kishore Bharati Ashram School. It cuts through dense forests of shimul and palas - bright red flowers makes the trek route more colorful.The Bamni and Turga Falls comes in the route and a lake called Lake Tarpaniya are major attraction of this trek.The sunrise at Mayur Pahar (Peacock Hills) is a treat to watch. The descend is via Baghmundi side. You can see Sita Kund on the way. Gorgaburu is the highest peak (2250 Feet) of Ajodhya Hills which can be seen on the way back.Why Ayodhya Hills is a must Visit PlaceThis area is full of natural beauty, colors and heavenly landscapes.It forces you to re-think if, the evolution from a tribe to an urban was really a boon to us?It made me feel that people in cities are so deprived of the actual wealth of life.The Santhals are way richer than us. They have wealth of nature, purity, peace and beauty.You got be very lucky to be a Santhal. Not every one is that lucky.For more such out of the box travel destinations visit my personal blog www.lonelymusafir.com",

		"Text": "PC &#x2013; Praveen Sridhar, Mahesh Prasad and Rucha KhotFollow @ruchaflora on Instagram@Travel Diaries with Love on FacebookBucket lists are so mandatory to some. They are atleast to me. A famous Hindi dialogue by Rajesh Khanna goes like this &#x201D; Babu Moshaiya, zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahi&#x201D;, literally translated it means that life should be big and worthwhile and not just long. To make it worthwhile we need memories, to make memories we need experiences and to garner and treasure these experiences what better way than to travel and keep dreaming about seeing your favourite places. Well, so here goes one more of my favourites trending in my mind since 2016. Prague, Czech Republic. I could roam to most of the European cities during my deputation in Europe, 2016 onwards, but never came an occasion which could take me to Prague, luck and determination is important you know. Finally in 2018 &#x201D; muhurta ala&#x201D;, or simply speaking the time had come. I planned Czech with Praveen and Mahesh my all-time favourite travel buddies and strongest comrades. Few people define friendship through their actions and these two are my best men.You will find many things to do or not do in Prague on Google and the internet of course, but I am listing down some of the few best experiences that gave me a heart in this place. It was raining when we visited Prague. We were here for three days, but the next two days we had good sunshine. Prague is easily watchable on foot and with metro, you do not need extra public transport to travel from one place to another if you are a good walker or runner. There are two trekking points uphill near the castles where you might require extra efforts otherwise the center of the city is pretty much alive and healthy all throughout the day.Mind you I was five months pregnant when I embarked upon this journey of a lifetime. I call it the journey of a lifetime because I do not know when I will visit Prague and Czech once again after my Little One comes into this world, because there are other places to explore and discover as well!!When To GoIn Prague and the Czech Republic, the tourist season runs roughly from Easter through October. July and August have their advantages, with the best weather and longer days, fewer tourists in Prague than in the peak season of May, June and September. In spring and fall, the weather is milder and the colors and scents are more powerful.Winter travelers find the concert season in full swing, with remarkably fewer tourists, also many sights are closed or open on a limited schedule. In December there are Christmas markets on main squares around the country, fragrant with the scent of hot wine with cloves.Prague Old TownThe center of Prague is Old Town. This is where you will find the iconic picture of the town and the spiky topped Church Of Our Lady of St. Tyn across from the Astronomical Tower. This square is filled with Christmas markets or Easter Markets during the right season. Take an elevator at the top of the Town Hall Tower and enjoy the view. Ignore the throngs of tourists and the hawkers that try to sell you everything under the sun or you can enjoy at the Starbucks on the square with a steaming hot cup of coffee. The center of the city has a rich culture and scientific heritage, well preserved with a skyline of spiky towers, medieval cathedrals, and Victorian age buildings.From the Square you can get to the Wencelas Square which is an enormous long square lined with retailers that you find anywhere in Europe, capped with the National Museum. The famous Velvet Revolution began in this part of the city!Prague Castle Prague Castle is a fortified hill with several different things to take in. You have to pay to get into the premises, but the ticket lasts for two days. Highlights of the hill include the St. Vitus Cathedral, whose towers dominate the skyline of the hill, and you can climb one of the towers. There are also several exhibits about the history of the castle, and the palace buildings. A row of old low houses called the Golden Row once housed the city&#x2019;s famous author Franz Kafka.At this spectacular castle with a view you will learn about individual buildings and gardens, with a selection of modern and ancient stories. A majestic chapel greets you as you enter the top and special spiral potato chip vendors, corn-corb vendors, jelly vendors etc. greet your way as you tread uphill. It was Easter time when I visited Prague with my friends so we had a feast at the food festival on the top. There was fried bacon on olive and mayo salad dressings, scrumptious and huge burgers which had cheese oozing out from the sides, yummy skewers and marinated chicken grills places on hot plates to entice the customers, sizzling and creamy flavors of waffles with all the fruity flavors you could dream of, the traditional sausages laid out with freshly baked oven bread, the list can go on, it was a treat to the eye to see so many yummy and vibrant food colors. As we moved around in the castle, we entered the chapel in a few minutes and this did not catch my eye, after seeing most of Europe, all chapels start looking similar and the same happened with me.Charles SquareThis magnificent beauty is one of the largest squares of the world and interestingly was the largest town square of medieval Europe. It was founded in 1348 by Charles the fourth and then named after him, at that time it was known as the Cattle Market till the 15th century, after much adieu in 1848 it was named after its founder. Charles Square also has a dedicated park that runs from 1860. It has one of the city&#x2019;s main metro station named as Karlovo namesti and numerous tram lines that make the roads busy in all the directions.Dancing House PragueThis iconic building was designed by Vlado Milunic in collaboration with Frank Gehry on a vacant river front plot. This building is pretty new and marks the beginning of modern architecture and liberal era in Czech Republic. It was designed in 1992 and was fully functional in 1996. The design is absolutely modern and controversial. On a street full of Gothic and Baroque architecture, this piece of art stands out. The house actually resembles a pair of dancers therefore the name Dancing House. It has a perfect location in front of the river front and can be reached easily via Prague Metro.Charles Bridge Charles Bridge is one of the most visited sights in the whole of the Czech Republic. It is the oldest stone bridge in Prague and the second oldest in the Czech Republic which have survived until today. Its reputation gained name thanks to the connection of strict Gothic and monumental Baroque sculptural decoration. 30 statues and a crucifix have been placed here for over 300 years. Over the bridge you can find the famous Royal Route. It was also important from a military point of view when the Swedes attacked the city in 1648. In the past the bridge was used by horse trams, trams, buses and even cars. As one of the only reliable river crossing in the entire region, Charles Bridge played an important role in boosting the commerce and transportation all around the city of Prague. During its long history, the bridge adapted to many types of use, being briefly used for trams, carrying armies, and in recent times being entirely dedicated to pedestrian use. Today, however, it is dedicated to pedestrians only. The bridge is 516 meters long and 10 meters wide. It is carried by 16 pillars and is constructed of sandstone blocks. In 2010 an extensive renovation of Charles Bridge was completed.Astronomical ClockOne of the world&#x2019;s oldest working astronomical clocks, complete with animated wooden figures that come alive in a captivating must-see show every hour. Crowds gather in the Old Town Square throughout the day to witness this famous ceremony. Small doors on the clock open as the bells begin, before animated figures appear and sculptures move. A figure of Death holding an hourglass looks forward to the change of the hour, whilst other sculptures representing vanity, greed and pleasure all look on. The oldest part of the clock itself is the astronomical dial, beneath which you&#x2019;ll spot the calendar dial. The clock signifies the positions of the sun and moon, as well as the month which is symbolized by a detailed medallion below. The zodiacal ring also shows you the current star sign. It costs nothing to enjoy the spectacle at the Astronomical Clock, but you will have to pay a small charge to climb the tower. Visiting early in the day is recommended as large crowds gather here all through the day. There are also caf&#xE9;s around the square offering great spots to watch the ceremony while you enjoy a drink. Located in the Old Town Square, you can reach the Astronomical Clock easily both by tram and metro.Public Transport in PraguePublic Transport Tickets (valid on Metro/trams/buses)\tAdults &amp; Students\tChildren 0-9 yrs (6yrs+ must carry a passport or photo ID)Single Ticket for 90 minutes travel\t32czk (crowns)\tfreeSingle Ticket for 30 minutes travel\t24czk\tfree1-Day Pass (24 hours)\t110czk\tfree3-Day Pass (72 hours)\t310czk\tfreeDo&#x2019;s and Dont&#x2019;s in PragueI&#x2019;ve found that the best exchange rate you can get is to use your debit card and withdraw money from local ATM&#x2019;s. Just make sure you are in a well guarded area when you make a withdraw.Don&#x2019;t ever change money with people on the street.Prague&#x2019;s worst problem are petty thieves. Always make sure you close all your bags, don&#x2019;t have your money or passport in back pocket and be on alert.I would also suggest to reduce the amount of jewelry you put on. Thieves usually concentrate in main tourist areas and work in teams.Even though Czech is now a member of EU they still use crowns. You will need to have some cash as most small business still operate on cash basis and I would not just give them my credit card.Going to a restaurant in the heart of Prague can be expensive even by western standards. Try to avoid those restaurants and cafes in the main tourist areas, instead ask locals where there is a good restaurant with local cuisine or track a few hundred meters away from the main tourist tracks.The best way I found is to use the local underground (Metro). It is very cheap, fast and gets you to most places you would want to go.The main language is Czech, many people in Prague speak German and these days a lot of young people can speak English since its being taught in schools.Unless you absolutely love using maps and driving do not drive in Prague. It is a very old city, the streets are usually one way and it is being repaired all the time so the rules keep changing pretty much every day.Based on a three day experience this is my perspective and aspect of Prague for you. I went on to explore Prague for three whole days and stayed at a hostel that my friend Mahesh had booked on Booking.com 5km away from the center of the city. We used public transport at most places and it was quite cheap. One night we explored the night scene of the city and I was damn sure that the city is not safe for lonely girls after 10pm at night. Compared to other European countries Czech is pretty affordable with food, stay and even travelling by Taxi if you download the Uber App. Private taxis can cost you a lot. We ate lavishly and even tried the dessert delicacies that I found a bit over-priced as they came under the gourmet category. Overall I believe only if you are planning to do a pub prowl or sky diving is one more extra day required in Prague, I had to avoid both as I was pregnant, but nevertheless, a second time in Prague will certainly not be boring on top of the hill&#x2026;Until next time with a blog on Portugal..Rucha Sudhir KhotTravel Addict.Credits &#x2013; I referred Wikipedia for mathematical figures and exact measurement of monuments, as well as to know the time period.Pamphlets received at these locations also came in handy to combine historical information, the pamphlets were received in German.",

Even after planning and arranging everything on my own it costed us a lot.Me and my girlfriend started our trip from New Delhi IGI airport and landed in Oslo on 11th Feb morning; As per plan spent 2 days here exploring the city. Capital of Norway &amp; most populous city of Norway welcomed us with -3&#x2019;C temperature. We explored the city by every means possible i.e. Bus, Metro, Trams, trains and local taxis. It&#x2019;s beautiful country covered with Snow in February with a great history of Norwegian Vikings and mostly famous for it&#x2019;s damn awesome natural fjords. There was a lot to cover in every step with countless museums, historical architecture, Viking history attractions and many other. Take a walk in front of Parliament of Norway, and don&#x2019;t forget to visit Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. Oslo central Station and it&#x2019;s surroundings are most happening places in Oslo and also a place to start your little shopping of local stuff. City&#x2019;s hop on/off buses are best way to cover most of these places.What you shouldn&#x2019;t miss in Oslo-Viking Ship Museum - Located in Bygdoy, museum provides historic ships made by vikings in year of 850 and you can have a nice view from the balconies they have made for proper look.The Vigeland Museum- Awesome art in form of painting, woodcuts and sculptures made by famous artist of Gustav Vigeland. I feel his whole life can be viewed from this museum and it&#x2019;s more than 15000 artifacts.Oslo Opera House - National Opera &amp; Ballet House of Norway. We didn&#x2019;t go inside of it but really admired the beautiful architecture from outside &amp; had a long walk.Royal Place- This huge monument reminded me of President house in India but of course the snow covered around building and that cold weather made it memorable.City Hall and Parliament of Norway would definitely come in the list with Fram museum with that triangle architecture. Take a bicycle on rent or do a walking tour around Oslo central station - you will really enjoy doing and seeing things on your own then taking a guide. Though if you like more detailed info on everything then take a guide. There are many different packages once you visit Oslo tourist information center and yes in any city of Norway take a city pass, it saves a lot of money and comes very handy and all kind of visits and transportation &#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;After Oslo, we took a train to Bergen &#x2014;&#x2014; follow for Bergen Rail and many other adventures in Country of Vikings &amp; Fjords II (Bergen)#Oslo #Norway #Vikings #Travel #Fernweh #Fjords #Northernlights",

		"Text": "Set at the base of the Mullayangiri range of the Western Ghats, Chikmagalur is a small town about 250 km from Bangalore. The town itself is quite unassuming but the district, the town&#x2019;s namesake is a treasure trove for travelers, with hidden gems strewn across it.\nDay 1ChikmagalurHotelsMapThe plan for Chikmagalur was a shelved one which had suddenly come to life over bouts of drunken weekend gossips. This time I had teamed up with an old crony from school, Ishan Roy and a couple of his friends, who over the course of the trip became very close to me as well. A long time ago we had a lengthy discussion over the phone about the new Zostel that had come up in Chikmagalur and that we ought to be checking it out sometime. But being in different cities, that &#x201C;sometime&#x201D; never came until this time. It was a stroke of luck that I was in Bangalore for a couple of months and this is when the old plan came back to life again.It was early June and the monsoon had still not set with all its fury. When we started from Bangalore early morning on a weekend, it was quite sunny and honestly, I was a wee bit disappointed. Afterall, being a pluviophile deep within I always hoped to get experience the monsoon of the Western Ghats. Four hours and an uneventful drive later the skies started darkening as the Google map showed that we were only a few kilometers away from Chikmagalur. It was almost noon by the time we reached Zostel Chikmagalur, a picturesque property set amongst lush coffee plantations.Zostel Chikmagalur.Devaramane ViewpointHotelsMapIt was supposed to be a breezy couple of days, an itinerary on steroids, even though it is a gross injustice for such an idyllic location. We set upon the day&#x2019;s itinerary without further ado. The first place on the list was Devaramane, a secluded peak with commanding views of lush valleys and rolling grasslands, locally called Sholas. The road to Devaramane made us drive through dense forests, coffee plantations, and beautiful hamlets. The red-tiled roofs of the village huts amongst the dazzling green made these villages look like straight out of fairy tales. Approaching Devaramane, I was finally greeted with the first splashes of rain, Monsoon in the Western Ghats, a long-cherished dream come true for me.On the way to DevaramaneThe Little Red CarHirekolale lakeHotelsMapDevaramane is a place that has the power to evoke spiritual introspections, a place for poets and lovers alike. One can sit on the grassy peak and while away the hours, float away in the dreamy ruminations. When we had reached Devaramane, the rain had stopped, after almost an eternity of getting lost in the intoxicating conversations and pensive thoughts, the heavens started to open up once again. I looked up to realize that dark clouds had obscured the horizon and it was threatening to drench us. We decided to leave Devaramane for our next destination, Hirekolale lake, some 46 odd kilometers away.Beyond the Horizon: Devaramane.Happy Feet.Hirekolale is one of the most serene lakes that I have been to. It served as the main water source for Chikmagalur before the construction of Yagachi dam. The lake is surrounded by rolling hills covered in pristine dense forests. Sitting by the lakeshore and watching the sun slip behind the hills with an interplay of shades of red and orange turn to deep shades of purple and blue over the canvas of sky was magical! The visiting hours to the lake are till 6 pm as there have been leopard sightings near the lake, which I believe live in the surrounding forests. So, we decided to leave even though this was an ideal place for camping, campfire, and star gazing.The picturesque Hirekolale LakeAlthough we had completed the day&#x2019;s excursions, the evening was quite enthralling at Zostel, with all the fellow hostellers unraveling their day&#x2019;s stories over hot cups of local coffee. This is perhaps the best thing about traveling, getting to know people, share stories and making new friends.Day 2Baba BudangiriHotelsMapMorning brought an azure sky with a white patchwork of clouds, a concoction of fresh smell of the earth from the overnight rain and blooming flowers being blown about in the cool breeze. We set out early, our first stop was the famous Baba Budangiri, some 40 kilometers from Zostel. The drive to Baba Budangiri is a beautiful one, through verdant rain forests. Legend has it that Baba Budan, a Sufi saint smuggled seven seeds of coffee from Syria on his way back from the pilgrimage to Mecca in the 16th century. On his return home, he planted the beans on the slopes of the Chandragiri Hills. Such were the humble beginnings of coffee cultivation in India. Since then, coffee cultivation has been commercialized and Chikmagalur has come to be known as the &#x201C;Coffee Land&#x201D;. Baba Budangiri is a holy site for both Hindus and Muslims alike. On the way to Baba Budangiri is the Jhari Waterfalls and the Mullayangiri peak.Mullayanagiri PeakHotelsMap  \tOn the way to Manikyadhara from Baba Budangiri&quot;In my rearview mirror, My life is getting clearer&quot; - Bon JoviFurther on, from Baba Budangiri, about 4 kilometers lie the Manikyadhara waterfalls, again a holy site. The hills abound Chikmagalur abound with legends and myths. There is a popular legend that says saint Baba Budan came here in search of water and after his prayers, the place was blessed with water that flows from this waterfall. This place is a sacred spot for both Hindus and Muslims and it is believed that a bath in its waters can cure ailments. As part of the beliefs, one must leave one of the clothes here, which over time has left the place littered with garments, an eyesore amongst the scenic beauty. Even though the falls failed to impress us, the viewpoint is scenic with mist and clouds rolling up the mountains making it a scintillating place for photographs.Hello World!Manikyadhara Waterfalls - ಮಾಣಿಕ್ಯಧಾರಾ ಜಲಪಾತHotelsMapThis time I had been constrained by the sheer lack of time yet on the hindsight I felt lucky that we could squeeze this trip. On further reflections, while driving through the rain-soaked greens of the forests, I realized that the rains though had upset my plans (rather I was caught unprepared in terms of gear and clothing), it had given me another excuse to visit Chikmagalur. I wanted to trek through the Kurdermukh National park to the second highest peak of Karnataka, have another shot at Mullayangiri, stay at Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary and probably a lot more which for the time being have to wait for another time. Till then, Dasvidaniya Chikmagalur!Dasvidaniya Chikmagalur!",

		"Text": "The pumping sound of music was deafening , the heavy bass can be felt around the complete periphery of the village, it was the last day of the year 2017 in katagla(village in himachal pradesh). We were a group of five friends spending the last minutes of the year partying after a long tired journey from delhi.We needed to wake up early the next morning for our trek to prashar lake which was from baggi village in mandi district of himachal pradesh.We got up a little late and as per our plan, we took the fastest possible way to reach baggi. We reached mandi at around 4 in the evening due to heavy rush and traffic.We were already behind our schedule but we stuck to our plan and hired a taxi to take us to baggi village, meanwhile the chilliness was continuously increasing and night and rain added to adverse situations. We reached baggi at around 7 pm in the evening, the rain stopped but the hill spotting the prashar lake was completely enveloped in dense fogs.It was a full moon night and the charm of the place just blinded our mind to reach the spot that we planned and we started our trek at 7:10 in the night. It was a five to six hours trek and planned to reach the top till quater past eleven or early.Trekking in night was a whole new experience for us, we were walking through the dark woods and the eeriness of the place was increased by the sudden voices that resounded in the forest. We trekked for around three hours complete without any major halts until our footsteps stopped to admire the plethora of beauty created by the fresh snow on a down valley. Trees were completely covered in snow and the moonlight washing the tip of the leaves just created the place a complete paradise.The iciness of the place was increased with temperatures dropping to negatives, we didn&apos;t wasted too much time there and kept on moving for around an hour until we were lost.The white sheet completely engulfed the mountain with no sign of trail leading to our destination, all our efforts to find the way were just going in vain. We tried collecting some wood and igniting the fire to keep us warm but to our disappointment, the cold wave just froze everything including our hopes.We were stranded nowhere till we saw a light coming from downhill, we went there instantly and saw a room with nobody in there. That light came as a ray of hope to brighten our fortune in this pitch black darkness, the room was locked and we had no other option than to break in to save our lives from the extreme weather.That room in that queer place was perfect for all of us, it had firewood,1000 w heater,five blankets,three mattress and some grains to fill our hungry bowels. We were rejoiced to get in there and spent the night eating plain rice with no salt. It was a very long day for all of us, but as we all say &quot;All is well that ends well&quot;. We got up the next morning and started our trek agian in the bright sunny day,we directly struck the trail without any futher problems. In the meantime, we met the caretaker of the room and explained him our circumstances and paid for the damage.We completed our trek in next one hour and returned to our regular lives after two days but the night created a great impression teaching us a lesson for life.",

		"Text": "Day 1Goa is calling resistance is futile. They say that plans of Goa are made to get canceled. Well that&apos;s not entirely true because BOOM! I just proved them all wrong.It all started with a extreme urge to go somewhere to chill and what&apos;s better than the &apos;Chill Capital of India&apos;? So Goa was decided then. Shared the plan with my mains who somewhat share the same mental disorder that I have. And they were in, God bless them.Ok I think I can start with the blog now. So I live in Gandhinagar, Gujarat which means I had to catch my flight from Ahmedabad which costed us INR3800 per head for non-stop round trip flight. Yes, you read it correctly; it costed us INR3800. I had booked my flights almost a month in advance. Now accommodation. There is a resort named Goa Club Estadia in Bardez. My very dear friend pulled some strings and managed to book us a suite in the resort at the same time when I booked our tickets. You can find a ton of hotels or villas to your liking online through OYO or AIRBNB app too.Flight taken care of? Check &#x2714;&#xFE0F;Hotel booked? Check &#x2714;&#xFE0F;We reached Goa at 4:30pm. I was careful to book the flight in a way that we reach Goa before evening. The next thing we did was to find a cab to our hotel. Now as I&apos;m on the topic of cab let me tell that there is no OLA cabs or UBER in Goa, all there are private cabs that are like sharks, always in a mood to rip you off. The 50 min cab ride from the airport to our hotel costed us INR1200. Please use the public transport when you visit Goa. My friend who reached Goa the previous night was already waiting at the hotel when we arrived and she was kind enough to make arrangements for the blast we were gonna have that night. After checking in the hotel (to our pool facing suite; please excuse my bragging), the party started. The first evening we just relaxed had a couple (Read: couple of crates) of beers and then we took over Mall de Goa which is supposedly the biggest mall in whole of Goa. So the evening was spent in doing some shopping and bowling and some more partying.Day 2Day 2: Hangover. But waking up in a room bathed in sunlight is a instant cure to hangover which I learnt there. After a hearty breakfast we lazed in the hotel pool for some time. Later we booked a cab from our hotel to baga beach, again a rip off. I would suggest you to rent a vehicle of your own a two wheeler would cost around INR 450 and a car for INR 1500 for one day. The beach, it was just splendid. Having lunch at a shack with the view of endless sea at a open restaurant has a charm of it&apos;s own. The day was spent exploring the beach and the markets around it after which we headed to find some cool bar. The sad part was that day some election results were out so it was a dry day, but being a hotelier has some perks of it&apos;s own. I managed to convince the restaurant manager of my hotel to provide me a bottle of wine and anything else that we might want. End of day two.Day 3Day 3 was quite eventful. We woke up early and after breakfast we rented out a car for a tour of north Goa which would cost you INR 1800 for the whole day. We first headed towards Fort Aguada. The Fort Aguada and its lighthouse is a well-preserved seventeenth-century Portuguese fort standing in Goa, India, on Sinquerim Beach, overlooking the Arabian Sea. After absorbing the views we headed towards Anjuna beach. This beach had water and sand too like every other beach! Not that interesting as expected. Moving on, we went to Vagator beach. This beach was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Standing on a small cliff with sandy beach on both sides dotted with coconut trees is just perfect. The beach seemed endless. It couldn&apos;t get any better. It took us a couple of hours to soak the scenery of it, we simply couldn&apos;t get enough of it.Our final destination was the famous Chapora Fort. Let me tell you the fort is a must visit if you go to Goa anytime. Now, Chapora fort is the same fort where one scene of the iconic film Dil Chahta Hai was shot. The fort sits on a prominent position which commands views in all directions. It also has steep slopes on all sides and a natural valley to the beach is protected by some rocks.Time to head to a club, Now there are many clubs and pubs in Goa but there are only a few worth going. There is club Cabana, Brittos, Tito&apos;s and Baga deck that I shortlisted. We finalized Tito&apos;s as it was fairly close to my hotel (also the manager promised to give me a nice discount if I came there, it never hurts to have some contacts here and there!) At Tito&#x2019;s there are two discotheques, one is our desi Bollywood theme with all the DJ remix kind of songs going on and the other is videshi Hollywood theme with all the latest pop remix and EDM songs. We obviously choose the later. The inside of the disco was a ambience I never imagined. The interior was dim but bright enough to be comfortable, the dance floor, the overhead spotlights and everything was just what is expected at a discotheque. And yes, unlimited drinks so CHEERS FELLAS!!!Now before we hit the club I managed to score some pot from a friendly negro and I was high as fuck and we all went nuts at the disco with the drinks. I&#x2019;m thankful that I didn&#x2019;t throw up and embarrass myself but I don&#x2019;t remember much of that night, except that we came out of the club at around 2:30 am, called our driver and had a shwarma or a sandwich while we waited. Have no idea when we reached our hotel. LolDay 4Day 4 started with a hangover of epic proportions. Gulped down a beer, which actually helped with the hangover and tried to recollect the happenings of last night. After a quick plunge in the pool and breakfast we again set out to explore the famous churches of Goa.So again we booked a taxi for INR 2200 for the whole day sight seeing of South Goa and its churches. The first stop was Our Lady of the Immaculate Church at Panjim. This church was originally built in the 1541 by the Portugese sailors as a place to conduct their mass. It was then rebuilt in the 1600 and the church was expanded and the ancient bell from the ruins of the St. Augustine (We would be visiting this place later) was installed. We then moved towards the Bascilla of Bom Jesus, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This site holds the mortal remains of Saint Fancis Xavier. It is said that the body is as fresh as the day the Saint passed away. The body till this date attracts a huge crowd from all over the world every ten years when the body is put up for public display. The body of Saint Francis Xavier is said to have miraculous healing powers. This place gives such amazing vibes that you must visit it.We then set off towards the Ruins of Saint Augustine&apos;s church. This is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was built sometime between 1957 and 1602. This place is mostly ruins due the neglect of the Portuguese government in the past. Only one tower remains standing out of the original four. The main attraction of the Church, a ancient bell, was shifted to Our Lady of Immaculate church in the year 1871, as mentioned before.We had enough dose of churches and wanted to get our feet wet again so we set off towards the Miramar Beach. We were fortunate enough to plan our trip during the month of June as it is not bustling with people at this time and we can enjoy with peace. We spent the rest of the afternoon and most of the evening at Miramar gazing at the endless sea and trying the local food joints and bars. Tried the Kaju Feni for the first time and it was the BOMB. Tequila is not even half of what Feni is.We were so bloody exhausted that we decided to head towards the hotel and freshen up. After a round of passing blunts we settled on ordering room service. Some more partying and that concluded the day.Day 5Day 5: The the last day of our trip. We woke up fairly early as we had to make the most of out last day. After freshening up we packed our bags as we had our flight at night. While having breakfast we decided to bar hop the entire day and then return to our hotel in the evening to leave for the airport. The front desk executive was kind enough to give us a list of must visit bars and pubs of Goa. We narrowed down to Sinq, Souza Lobo&apos;s Palm Pub, De Baga deck and Britto&apos;s shack.This day was so amazing that I can only remember bits and part of it. I promise to update the post as I recollect the happenings of that day.&#xA0;This concludes the end of my trip, here are a few things you need to keep in mind if you are visiting Goa.1. Pack light, you are visiting a beach side place not some fashion capital. The less you pack the better. Just be careful not to wear anything that anyone might find offending.2. Try to mix and communicate with the locals as they know the best places that you wont even find on Google.3. Up your bargaining game if you are in Goa.4. The Goans are very proud so be respectable to them and their place.So that&apos;s it, this was my trip to Goa. Looking forward to hearing from you if you need something to ask or anything. Happy travelling guys!!!",

		"Link": "https://www.tripoto.com/trip/how-to-plan-an-eco-friendly-trip-on-a-budget-5b68fc81d3d44",
		"Text": "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. These are practices that you take seriously in your daily life but what about when you are on the road? As more people travel around the world, we hear of more instances of littered mountains and beaches. Although our need to explore new places is justified, there is also an urgent need for us to be more sustainable while traveling. If you are deeply pained by videos of fish swimming in oceans of garbage and want to make an active effort to be a more responsible traveler, then read on as I share a few tips on how to plan an eco-friendly trip on a budget.1) Walk the TalkOne of my favorite ways of exploring a new place is on foot. Not only do you not burn fossil fuel, you also get to experience a place like a local and to understand what it means to live in that country. Nothing comes close to the joy of putting on your favorite shoes, grabbing an old-school map and spending hours navigating and discovering new destinations. Admittedly, I do get lost every now and then, but hey, that&#x2019;s travel!     \n2) Avoid Tourist PackagesAlthough tourist agencies offer convenient and reliable options, most of them are highly unsustainable and are often way more expensive than doing those activities by yourself. Before any trip, I take out time to research and scope potential activities and trips that I find interesting. I then get in touch directly with operators that follow responsible tourism practices and book my eco-friendly trip at discounted prices. 3) Take Time Out to VolunteerOne of the best ways to bring about a positive change while traveling is by volunteering. I would also argue that it is one of the best ways to experience a new place. Not only do you get to work for a positive cause, you also learn what it means to live life as a local. One of the most rewarding travel experiences of my life came about in Slovakia where I, as a part of an international team, volunteered to educate school students against the effects of climate change. We worked, lived and ate together, exchanging anecdotes on issues ranging from politics to religion and science. Definitely one of the best eco-friendly trips I have ever taken.4) Buy LocalA big part of the fun of being in a new country is the opportunity to try new food and to buy souvenirs that you won&#x2019;t get back home. It is common knowledge that the further the goods travel, the more impact they have on the environment. Every time I visit a new country on an eco-friendly trip, I avoid big chains such as Subway and McDonald&apos;s as much as I can. Eating local gives you incredible insight in to how the locals eat as well as an opportunity to support hard working locals who need your money more than KFC! Similarly, if you like shopping for souvenirs, look for local craft shops for authentic and sustainable goods.5) Pack SmartFlying is one of the most harmful activities for the environment. Additionally, the more weight planes carry, the more fuel they burn. On top of that, since most airlines charge extra for checked-in luggage, try packing all your stuff in just the carry-on. Think that can&#x2019;t be done? Roll your clothes to save room, stuff your underwear and socks in your shoes and use Ziploc bags to save even more space! Finally, use the PackTheBag app &#x2013; it promises to never let you forget something for an eco-friendly trip.6) Discourage the Use of Exotic Animals as Tourist AttractionsMany tourist attractions around the world offer unique experiences with exotic animals such as tigers, elephants, or dolphins, but the unfortunate reality is that most such tourism establishments exploits these poor animals for financial gain. Young elephant calves are separated from their mothers upon child birth and are trained in inhumane conditions for years so that they grow up to become obedient ride-givers. Similarly, lions and tigers are drugged so that tourists can pet them and take photos with them. If you are pained by such incidents and want to act, it is best for you to completely boycott such tourist traps and to share the information with friends. Likewise, do not feed or interfere with wild animals at national parks and zoos, and avoid buying products that are made from endangered animal products like ivory, fur or feathers. This is one of the easiest ways to take an eco-friendly trip.A traveler at heart, I have been to 22 countries on 6 continents. My favorite experiences are plunging in to sub-zero Antarctic waters, renovating a Buddhist monastery in Sri Lanka and hiking Borneon jungles. I am also an engineer, a public speaker, a sustainability believer and a polar explorer. Follow my misadventures on www.passportuncontrol.com and Instagram @geeknextdoor",

		"Text": "Visiting Hon Khoi Salt Fields Nha TrangOn the bus from Phu Yen to Nha Trang, I stopped at Hon Khoi salt village - Ninh Hoa district - Khanh Hoa province. Asking the driver how to get to the salt village, he pointed me to the junction right on the road near the gas station on Highway I. Get off the bus, I take a motorbike taxi on a road long about 5-6km to reach the Doc Let sea area - Ninh Hoa. Going to the beach, I seeking a hostel nearby.First impressions with Hon Khoi Salt FieldsHon Khoi salt village in Khanh Hoa is a small countryside, not developed much in tourism. Here, locals still mainly doing farming, fishing and salt making. Nature has created here Doc Let beach with the sand long and fine white, sea waters as green as Nha Trang beach, but get peaceful and rustic more. In addition to the beautiful beach, Ninh Hoa also famous for salt making, also known as Hon Khoi salt village. Photographing of the salt village was my main purpose in this trip because I was captivated by the pictures of the farmers raking salt under the sun early. The diligent footsteps, the skillful movements which show passionate about the work and with drops of sweat of strenuous.One thing surprised me was the booking.com also appeared in this countryside where still undeveloped on tourism. Probably due to many Western backpackers know Doc Let. They were the tourists who want to explore the secluded wilderness, where suited to enjoy the peaceful feeling instead of the hustle and bustle of the famous tourist resorts. The motorbike taxi turning into Ha Huy Tap Street to take me to Doc Let beach, the end of the road as the Resort. Along the way, there&apos;s a range of nice and clean hotels where mainly reserved for tourists.I chose Thuy Duong Hotel for a night here. Normally, these hotels were not too crowded, prices very cheap, depending on the way you bargain, or can be booked through Booking.com. If you want to stay in places where better facilities, you can choose one of two resorts at Doc Let Beach Resort: White Sand Doclet Resort &amp; Spa Nha Trang located on Ha Huy Tap street or GM Doc Let Beach Resort &amp; Spa. Both have a private beach and quite luxurious.Having left luggage, I ran out to find the way to the salt field to take pictures. Wandered on a motorbike borrowed from the innkeeper, I ran back to the town to seek the way lead to salt fields. Locals here still poor, the two sides only a few wealthy houses. The shops and eateries also not much too.As instructed by a locals man, I found a road leading to salt fields. However, at that time, no one worked here even though it was close to the sunset. I had asked nearby locals and know that when harvesting salt people usually wait for sunny days, and often in the early morning at dawn. They pointed me to a nearby salt factory, go back on the way lead to the fork. This factory is a vast salt field. The protector asked me if I were a photographer because he was probably too familiar with the photographers come here to work. He told me just come here in the morning nearly 5h, farmers will harvest salt, then spoilt for photographing.Visiting Hon Khoi Salt Fields Nha TrangAfter examined the shooting site for tomorrow, I returned the road leads to the hostel and find eatery and something to eat. Not see any nice-looking restaurant, I decided to ride straight up north to Hon Khoi port. This port as home to a number of cargo ships, around there as a small town quite deserted. I went around and found a small pub but no any diners. Ordered steamed shrimp and squid, sour soup of fish, I also reminded the hostess prepared the portion for one person.When the dishes were brought, I was surprised. It&apos;s a portion only for me, but too much food. Can not imagine that there&apos;s a place where such cheap seafood. Yes, this very place, a portion of shrimp, squid reserved for one person priced only about 5$, it even cheaper than a seafood meal in price about 40$ I ever ate in Vung Tau 4 years ago. On the days in Phu Yen, when on the backpacking trip in the Central region, I ate comfortably fresh seafood at cheap prices but come here, I was even more surprised.The phone alarm belled at 4 am, I hurriedly dressed, preparing the camera. Oh, that&apos;s bad! It&apos;s raining hard outside, so the plan was collapsed. I asleep again and decided stayed here more one night, I didn&apos;t able to go back home without any picture. Woke up on second times, it was late noon. I had going to have to ride the bicycle borrowed from the hostel because the motorbike was being used by someone else.I stopped at a street food stall, eaten a bowl of banh canh (thick noodle soup) which had a lot of cha (pork pies) only about 1$. It is true that in this place, everything all quite cheap, the face of anybody here looks also austere and strenuous. At this peaceful countryside, besides seafood, there&apos;s also has the typical cakes of the Central such as banh canh, rice paper and even has a very famous dish that is nem nuong Ninh Hoa. If you take to travel in Ninh Hoa, I recommend you must enjoy this delicious food. Nem nuong Ninh Hoa is processed from pork, add some traditional spices. Then it&apos;s being skewed into chopsticks and baked on a charcoal stove, its taste extremely delicious.Visiting Hon Khoi Salt Fields Nha TrangAt noon and early afternoon, here very sunny. Because there no place to go so I go back to the hostel and sit on the chair to get some fresh air. I saw a French couple on their bicycles just got come back, perhaps in the morning, they came to a nearby shipyard. Seem them in middle-aged, quite rustic, dressing quite casual and very open. I asked them what did they think about this land. They told me they enjoyed this peaceful land, just like Toulouse, their hometown in France. I believe this was not a courtesy saying, yes, here very peaceful, rustic.Wandering Doc Let beachVisiting Hon Khoi Salt Fields Nha TrangIn the afternoon, I walking on the beach. Here, the resort has enclosed a large part of Doc Let beach, if you did not stay in the resort and want to the beach via their gate, will be charged 30 Vnd of tickets. But there a free path, just go round the edge of the resort, it&apos;s reserved for locals. When I came to the beach, this place quite bustling, mainly the students gathered here to play and bathing. Doc Let beach very beautiful, the sand beach very long and winding so charm. I did not bathe, only walk and watching the sunset. There&apos;re many Western backpackers here, look they very joyful, bath and swimming comfortably, shooting for each other.At night, I go to the resort area and find a cafe. Sipping coffee and listening to the sound of the sea waves very interesting too. The innkeeper said that the tourist season in Doc Let usually begins from January to September every year. From October to December 12, should not come here because of this land quite cold by a corridor for the wind blows along the coast combined with cold air, causing very low temperatures.You may also like:Ly Son Island &#x2013; The Attractiveness Of The SeaPhotographing of salt village Hon KhoiEarly second day morning, fortunately, it was not raining. If no rain here, there definitely sunny because here the coastal area. On the old bicycle, I arrived the salt field. It took 30 minutes, finally, I reached the place. The Protector told me that the farmers were gathering salt. Smelling the sea salt at dawn, the feeling of cold at the feet when directly step on the salt field. It&apos;s weird but kind of cool!Visiting Hon Khoi Salt Fields Nha TrangThe farmers worked so hard and did not pay much attention to me, they probably too familiar with photographers who work here. They laughed, talked to me, asked me where I came from. This large salt field owned by a salt company, farmers often get up early and gather here to rake of salt, but if it&apos;s raining, usually the work will be delayed. They can work in the afternoon, but the most in the morning. I still focused on photographing, and they - rustic farmers keep doing their daily work ...Visiting Hon Khoi Salt Fields Nha TrangAfter having finished my work, it was 8 am, the sun was up highs. I sigh with relief, after a bad day due to rainy, finally, I have finished the album. Back to the hostel to check out, I took the bus to Nha Trang continued my journey. Goodbye Doc Let - Hon Khoi - Ninh Hoa, a peaceful countryside!",

And the nightlife includes clubs, bars, pubs and shopping centers where people are coming here to enjoy which are not that common in other parts of the country. Breathtaking views of mountains, serene monasteries and a unique blend of modern lifestyle and cultural heritage make Thimphu a must visit destination in Bhutan.A brief idea about the capital of Bhutan, Thimphu-My last year trip in December to Thimphu, Bhutan was essentially a myth-busting exercise. It was definitely one of the best spontaneous trips, with no travel plan at hand and a plenty to see and experience. Before this trip, I always thought that capital cities are generally equipped with hustle and bustle, high-rise buildings, crowded streets and heavy traffic. But my Thimphu trip proved me wrong by presenting different picture with its lovely landscape, warm-hearted people, without a traffic light and ornate Bhutanese architecture buildings. My Bhutan-Thimphu tour was about 12 days and believes me, these 12 days was giving me the best feelings ever. Some of the best places in Thimphu you should visit while traveling in Winter-As my personal point of view, winter is the best season to explore the natural beauty of Thimphu. As this time, the mountain wears a blanket of snow; the valley becomes colorful as the varieties of flowers are in full bloom. I spent the first few days exploring the most popular sights in Thimphu, which I have mentioned below-&#x2022;\tNational Memorial Chorten &#x2022;\tDochula Pass&#x2022; The Weekend Market &#x2022;\tZorig Chusum School of Traditional Arts &#x2022;\tThe National Folk Heritage Museum &#x2022; Zangthoperi Lhakhang These above-mentioned places of Thimphu city must be included in your itinerary if you are traveling during winter. I can bet you these places will blow your mind.Exciting adventure activities to do in Thimphu-I must say it is the place where you can get the best thrilling experience. However, there are a lot of things to do in Thimphu, but if you want more appropriate ones, then I will recommend you some activities which I had personally experienced in my Thimphu trip. I have mentioned those activities perfect for winter seasons-&#x2022;\tParagliding&#x2022;\tRiver-Rafting&#x2022;\tMountain biking&#x2022;\tKayaking&#x2022;\tCanoeingMore things about Thimphu you must know-Thimphu is just not a place just exploring sightseeing places and enjoy thrilling adventure activities, it has something more extra than any other places:&#x2022; The lively nightlife of Thimphu was mainly attracted me by its colorful pubs, clubs, bars and shopping centers. Club Ace, Mojo Park, Space 34 etc are the best places where you can enjoy your nightlife.&#x2022; You must taste local cuisines of Thimphu to get the mouthwatering taste. Ema Datshi, Kewa Datshi, Shakam Paa, Jasha Maru etc are the most delicious food I had ever eaten.&#x2022; Thimphu is also famous for its local art crafts. So you should not leave Thimphu without buying some unique souvenirs like Thangkas Painting, Singing Bowl, Mala Beads, Bhutan Handicrafts, Wooden Products etc.&#x2022; Thimphu being a capital city, it houses many resorts, hotels as well as homestays for a comfortable stay. But I recommend you before choosing, you must research the particular accommodation.Lastly, I m providing some useful information/tips for travelers:&#x2022; You should carry your passport along with your Voter ID Card to travel to Bhutan. &#x2022; Indians do not need any visa or advance application before entering Bhutan.&#x2022; If you are traveling during winter months, you must carry woolen jackets, mufflers, shocks, hand gloves, shoes, woolen shawls etc. You should also carry umbrella or raincoats, as rains are quite uncertain.&#x2022; You should carry also your needed medicines for your crucial situations.Overall, I must say Thimphu tourism gives me a memorable trip for a lifetime with its alluring nature as well as warm hospitality.",

		"Text": "The landscape of Himachal is no longer as we knew it a couple of decades ago. It is changing rapidly, and for worse. Most of the hill stations now are thick clusters of thousands buildings overspilling with millions of tourists. Shimla has water shortages, Manali has traffic jams, Mussoorie&apos;s strewn with garbage. The roads to all these destinations, which once used to be lined with grass and shrubs and fruit trees, are now infested with shops and hotels all along. You only feel good about going to these places when you&apos;re from a dirty, big city like Delhi where even clean air has become a commodity. It&apos;s a sad, sad state of affairs...Thankfully, there are still a few corners of Himachal which have not been ruined been commercialisation, at least not yet. Tirthan Valley is one of them. She is a precious relic from the bygone days of Himachal, where time hasn&apos;t brought much of a difference to the way of life. Most of the people still don&apos;t own any vehicles or smart phones. There are no towering hotels blotting the beauty of the mountains; no exhaust-spewing queues of vehicles on the road. In fact, this place is so pure that it ruins you. I, even after having spent 2 weeks here, wept while going back to the smoke and squalor of Delhi. However, time is running out. Manali&apos;s become an eyesore and a pain in the ass (literally, because you spend hours sitting in your car stuck in traffic jams), and it&apos;s just a matter of time before all kinds of tourists begin swarming to other lesser-known places such as Tirthan Valley, which are in the hill station&apos;s vicinity. Travellers, you have to experience this place before that happens. Here&apos;s what to expect when you visit Tirthan Valley now -1. When you skip entering the tunnel at Aut and take a right instead, you are driving on an other-worldly tree-lined roads with the river flowing beside. The path feels right...\nTirthan ValleyHotelsMapSomewhere in Faryadi villageEnroute Sharchi2. Since there aren&apos;t any fancy hotels around (thankfully!), you&apos;ll be staying at one of the homestays or guesthouses in the area, where you will get to interact with the locals and experience their way of life. You can go apple-picking with them or discover one of the many shortcuts of getting up and down mountains. Krishan Homestay in Faryadi VillageNaginiHotelsMapSharchiHotelsMapSharchi3. Tirthan Valley is a giant fruit orchard. Depending on which season you are going, you&apos;ll be able to find fruit-laden trees everywhere. If you befriend the locals, they&apos;ll generously give you some freshly-picked fruit from their orchard, and believe me, it&apos;ll be the best fruit you would&apos;ve had in your life. Raju Bharti&#x27;s Guest HouseHotelsMapCherry Trees in MayPekhriHotelsMapApples in August at Apple Blush OrchardTirthan ValleyHotelsMapPears in July4. When you befriend the warm-hearted people of the place, they&apos;ll invite you to their homes and treat you to amazing Himachali food. We tried Siddu for the first time. Siddu is a large, soft dumpling made from dough and stuffed with walnuts and apples, or potatoes, and served with mint chutney and desi ghee. PekhriHotelsMapDelicious Siddu at Apple Blush OrchardFresh Rhododendron Juice at Apple Blush Orchard5. If you go to Tirthan in monsoon, you&apos;ll find flowers in the most gorgeous shades in full bloom. Raju Bharti&#x27;s Guest HouseHotelsMapTirthan ValleyHotelsMapPekhriHotelsMapTirthan ValleyHotelsMap6. You&apos;ll be able to go for long solitary walks or just sit by the river. Since you&apos;d have stepped out of your regular life, you&apos;ll be able to observe it from a distance and think about it, maybe even find answers to some of the questions which have been bothering you. In 2 weeks, I was convinced that I did not want to live in Delhi anymore and that I had to do something about it.7. You might even end up making some new non-human friends.SharchiHotelsMapA wild goat chaseRaju Bharti&#x27;s Guest HouseHotelsMapHello there &amp;lt;3Tirthan ValleyHotelsMapIsn&#x27;t he the cutest doggo ever?!8. You&apos;ll get to treat your eyes to the most gorgeous golden sunsets ever. 9. Wherever you go, you&apos;ll be able to find such breathtaking vistas. I went there in May, and then again in July, and both the times, I couldn&apos;t get enough of Tirthan&apos;s beauty. PekhriHotelsMap10. Are there any famous spots to check around? Well, there are many. Tirthan Valley houses the world-famous Great Himalayan National Park. It takes days to explore the entire area, and there are many wonderful treks in the park that lead to mighty waterfalls and amazing view points.Places to check out -If the idea of exploring the expansive park appears daunting to you, you can do other things instead such as checking out this amazing waterfall - Chhoie, which is an hour&apos;s trek from village Naagni.Chhoie WaterfallHotelsMapNaginiHotelsMapOr you can drive up to Sharchi, a village on a flat land on a top of a mountain- and the last village to which the bus goes. On sunny days, the village has a view of mighty snow-capped peaks. We went on a cloudy day and so couldn&apos;t see any snow-covered mountains, only thick, dark clouds kissing heavily forested mountain tops. However, that was phenomenal too. The village in itself is quite beautiful and unique, and therefore, is a must-visit when in Tirthan.SharchiHotelsMapYou can even venture away from Tirthan for a day and head to Jalori Pass. Jalori Pass is an hour&apos;s drive from Tirthan Valley&apos;s main town, Banjar. At Jalori Pass, the Serolsar Trek is a must-do. The 5-km trek is quite easy - a meandering path with not much of a slope. The trek takes about two and a half hours one way. So, the Serolsar Trek can be planned as a one-day trip while keeping Tirthan as a base. The Serolsar Lake also has some campsites for those wishing to spend the night there.Serolsar LakeHotelsMapJalori PassHotelsMapNow, something on the practical matters of travel and lodging.A Volvo from Delhi to Aut will cost you anything between 1200-1400 INR one way. From the Aut tunnel, you can either take a bus to Banjar costing 60 INR, or a cab which will charge 1100-1200 INR.There is an abundance of homestays, and small but comfortable guesthouses in the Valley. Some of the ones I know about are -Raju Bharti Guesthouse - It is perhaps the most famous property in Gushaini, which is why it is hard to get a booking here in the season. A comfortable bed + 3 meals &amp; tea + fresh fruits from their orchard is what you get in 1800 INR per person per day. Now, that&apos;s a killer deal!Khem Bharti Guest House - A Himachali-style bungalow in village Naagni. Price - 1800 to 2500 INR per room with breakfast.Krishan Homestay - A budget homestay with the most awesome host -Krishan. Tirthan Valley&apos;s only superhost on Airbnb. I spent most of my time here. 1100-1400 INR per room with breakfast. The river is a few minutes&apos; walk from the place and balcony has an amazing view. Excellent meals.Arjun Homestay - Newly built property. Rooms at 1500 INR with breakfast.Tara Homestay - A simple but homely cottage with a view of the river. They have a nice lawn. Complementary Breakfast.Pooja River View - Cosy rooms with complementary breakfast. View of the river from the property.Hemant Homestay - Some of the rooms have television. Complementary breakfast. They grow their own vegetables.Chetan Homestay -Rooms at 1000 INR with breakfast.All View Homestay - A property by the river. You have to cross the river in a ropeway to get here. They serve complementary breakfast.Tirthan Nature Camps - Campsite by the river. Budget-friendly packages for groups and families. They have a natural pool in the river in which you can swim safely.I&apos;ll be more than happy to pass on the contact information to these properties for those who wish to book at any of these places :)The area has one fancy cafe, the Himalayan Trout House which serves wood-fired pizzas, pastas and sandwiches.The Himalayan Trout HouseHotelsMapThere&apos;s booze shop in the Gushaini market which closes at 10 pm, and doesn&apos;t have many options. Also, it sells booze at a significantly higher price than it is available in cities. So, BYOB.Vodafone doesn&apos;t work at all in the area. Get a Jio or an Airtel SIM to remain connected to the rest of the world.There! I think I&apos;ve said pretty much everything I should. I fell in LOVE with Tirthan, so will you. It&apos;s hard to resist the charm of its simplicity.P.S. Feel free to message if you have any questions or need any help planning your itinerary.#offbeatplace",
